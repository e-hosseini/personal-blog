# Compression — Shrinking Code and Media Without Losing Power

You spend months building an amazing app, only to realize… your users are downloading 5MB of JavaScript and 15MB of images.

Even with all your fancy code splitting and tree shaking, you’re still sending far more bytes than necessary.

The solution? **Compression** — of both your code and your media assets.

This guide dives deep into:
- The history and mechanics of Brotli and Gzip
- How modern build tools compress JS, CSS, and HTML
- Optimizing media (images, videos, fonts)
- CDN and server config tips
- Real-world case studies from top web platforms

## Why Compression?

Compression reduces:
- Transfer size
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Data usage on mobile

In many apps, enabling compression can **halve** page weight.

It’s a backend concern — but with **massive frontend implications**.

## Gzip vs Brotli: What’s the Difference?

| Feature   | Gzip        | Brotli      |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Compression | Fast      | Better      |
| Ratio       | ~30-40%   | ~40-50%     |
| Speed       | Faster    | Slower      |
| Support     | All major browsers | All modern browsers |

Brotli is **better**, especially at higher levels. But Gzip is still a great fallback.

### Enable via server:

```nginx
gzip on;
brotli on;
brotli_static on;
```

Or via Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, etc.

---

## JavaScript + CSS Compression

Most bundlers output uncompressed `.js`, but serve Gzip/Brotli in production.

Webpack + Compression Plugin:

```js
new CompressionPlugin({
  algorithm: "brotliCompress",
  test: /\.(js|css|html|svg)$/,
})
```

Vite and Next.js support this out of the box.

---

## HTML Compression

Use server-level gzip + minified HTML templates:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div>
  <h1>   Hello   </h1>
</div>

<!-- After -->
<div><h1>Hello</h1></div>
```

Remove comments, whitespace, and unused templates.

## Image Compression

Images are the **heaviest part** of most UIs.

Strategies:
- Use modern formats: **WebP**, **AVIF**
- Compress before upload (e.g., TinyPNG, ImageMagick)
- Lazy-load offscreen images
- Resize images to max display dimensions
- Use responsive `srcset`

```html
<img src="image.avif" srcset="image-480.webp 480w, image-1080.avif 1080w" loading="lazy" />
```

---

## Video and Media

- Use **H.265** or **AV1** for better compression
- Host on adaptive platforms (Mux, Cloudflare Stream, YouTube embed)
- Avoid autoplay loops unless compressed aggressively

---

## Font Optimization

Fonts are often 100–300KB+.

Best practices:
- Use WOFF2 or WOFF
- Subset unused glyphs
- Use unicode-range
- Preload and cache aggressively

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

---

## Real-World Case Studies

### Twitter Lite

- Uses Brotli at level 11
- Images converted to WebP
- JS chunks compressed to 70% smaller size

### Airbnb

- Font subsetting reduced size from 240KB → 18KB
- Only loads images in viewport
- JS bundle shrinks from 1.6MB → 390KB post-compression

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Serving uncompressed assets (especially JS/CSS)
- Using PNG where JPEG/WebP is fine
- Not compressing images before uploading
- Overusing heavy font libraries (or multiple font weights)
- Using videos instead of animated SVGs or CSS

---

## Conclusion: Make Every Byte Count

Compression is invisible to users — but critical for experience.

It’s **cheap to implement**, **massive in payoff**, and **essential at scale**.

Whether it’s text or pixels — squeeze out what you don’t need.

And make your app feel lighter, faster, smarter.

Because on the web, size does matter.
