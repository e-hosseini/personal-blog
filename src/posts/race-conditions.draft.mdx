# Out-of-Order Responses & Race Conditions — Winning the Right Request

Modern UIs are full of **concurrent network calls** — and that creates opportunities for one of the trickiest bugs: **race conditions**.

A race condition happens when multiple async operations **compete**, and the one that finishes first wins — even if it **shouldn’t**.

For example:
- A user types “dog” → fetch for “dog” starts
- Then types “do” → fetch for “do” starts later, but returns first
- UI now shows results for “do”, even though “dog” is the latest input

This is a race condition caused by **out-of-order responses**.

In this article, we’ll dive into:
- Why race conditions happen
- How to detect and reproduce them
- Patterns to cancel, compare, or ignore stale responses
- Implementations in React using refs, tokens, and counters
- Real-world strategies from search inputs, autocompletes, and filters

## Why Race Conditions Matter

They’re subtle. They break trust.

A user types something — sees the wrong result. Or clicks to sort — and the old response overwrites the new one. Or opens a modal — and stale data loads in.

Most users won’t file a bug. They’ll just think your app is broken.

---

## Where Race Conditions Happen

- **Search inputs** (type fast, many requests fire)
- **Dropdown filters** (select, reselect quickly)
- **Tabs or modals** (navigate quickly)
- **Rapid navigation** (client-side router with prefetch)
- **Parallel data fetching** (combined effects or compound queries)

---

## Example of the Problem

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(setResults);
}, [query]);
```

This fires a fetch on each query change — but doesn’t cancel the previous one. If older fetches resolve last, they overwrite new ones.

---

## Solutions

### 1. AbortController (with fetch)

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();

  fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`, { signal: controller.signal })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(setResults)
    .catch(err => {
      if (err.name === "AbortError") return;
    });

  return () => controller.abort();
}, [query]);
```

This **cancels stale requests** before firing the new one.

---

### 2. Request ID Tracking

Use a ref to track the current request:

```tsx
const requestIdRef = useRef(0);

useEffect(() => {
  const id = ++requestIdRef.current;

  fetch(`/api/search?q=${query}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      if (id === requestIdRef.current) setResults(data);
    });
}, [query]);
```

Only the latest request can update state.

---

### 3. Sequence Token Pattern

Create a `makeCancelable` wrapper around each request:

```ts
function makeCancelable(promise) {
  let hasCanceled = false;
  const wrapped = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    promise.then((val) => (hasCanceled ? null : resolve(val)));
  });
  return {
    promise: wrapped,
    cancel: () => (hasCanceled = true)
  };
}
```

Use this to race and cancel old ones when needed.

---

## Race-Aware Libraries

### React Query

- Automatically **cancels** in-flight queries on refetch
- Deduplicates stale results

```tsx
useQuery(["search", query], fetchSearch, { keepPreviousData: true });
```

### SWR

- Ensures **latest response wins** using timestamps and cache keys
- `mutate()` respects freshness

---

## Real-World Examples

### GitHub Autocomplete

Typing in the issue search bar:
- Debounces input
- Cancels prior fetches
- Uses a race-safe cache layer

### VSCode Extensions Marketplace

- Filtering by publisher or keyword cancels old results
- Avoids UI flashing from stale entries

### Notion Link Picker

- As you type to find a page, only the latest result is shown
- No jumping or flickering due to out-of-order results

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Triggering fetch without cancel/ref guard
- Ignoring stale responses
- Updating state after component unmount (memory leak!)
- Using async/await in `useEffect` without cleanup
- Reacting to multiple input changes without debounce

---

## Conclusion: Control the Timeline

Race conditions aren’t about speed — they’re about **who should win**.

You’re not just fetching data. You’re coordinating a timeline:
- When did it start?
- When did it end?
- What else happened in between?

The answer isn’t “first come, first served.”

It’s “latest wins.”

And your UI should reflect that truth.
