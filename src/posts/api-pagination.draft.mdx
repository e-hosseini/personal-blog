# Pagination — Designing Scalable Data Windows

Pagination is more than just slicing a list. It’s a performance technique, a consistency strategy, and a user experience problem all rolled into one. And at scale, pagination is often one of the most **difficult things to get right** — especially when your data is constantly changing.

When you're dealing with massive datasets — think product catalogs, search results, chat logs, activity feeds — sending the entire dataset to the client is not an option. So we paginate. But how we paginate determines everything: performance, consistency, caching, user satisfaction, and even security.

This article takes you deeper than just offset vs cursor. We’ll explore pagination from the ground up — from SQL design to API ergonomics, frontend integration to production reliability.

## Why Do We Need Pagination?

Without pagination, even moderately sized data sets become unmanageable.

Consider an e-commerce site with:
- 500,000 products
- 1,000 orders per day
- 100+ concurrent users

Sending 10,000 results at once:
- Chokes the frontend rendering loop
- Consumes mobile bandwidth unnecessarily
- Triggers database timeouts or memory pressure
- Destroys perceived performance

Pagination enforces **bounded queries** and **incremental rendering**. It creates windows into large data sets, enabling:
- Search result navigation
- Admin dashboard browsing
- Feed rendering
- Background preloading
- Incremental filtering

## Key Pagination Strategies (with Deep Tradeoffs)

### Offset-based Pagination

```http
GET /products?offset=60&limit=20
```

🧠 Simple to understand and implement. Supported by SQL (`LIMIT`, `OFFSET`).

**Downside**: Insertion or deletion of rows **shifts everything**, leading to:
- Duplicate results across pages
- Skipped entries
- Inconsistent list states

💡 Use when: dataset is mostly static (e.g. archived logs, analytics), not real-time.

---

### Page-based Pagination

```http
GET /products?page=3&pageSize=50
```

💡 Adds user-friendly semantics. Good for UI pagination controls (1, 2, 3...).

Still subject to the same limitations as offset — but sometimes better UX for users than raw offsets.

📘 Design Tip: Always return `totalPages`, `totalCount`, `currentPage` in response metadata.

---

### Cursor-based Pagination (a.k.a. Relay-style)

```http
GET /posts?after=abcdef123&limit=25
```

Here, `after` is a base64-encoded cursor (e.g., post ID or timestamp).

🛠 Requires API to generate and manage stable cursors.

✅ Pros:
- Very consistent under mutation
- Great for live feeds, messages, social timelines
- Encourages stateless client navigation

❌ Cons:
- Harder to debug
- Can't jump to arbitrary pages (e.g. "page 30")
- Can break if cursor encoding/decoding logic is inconsistent

💡 Best when: Data is sorted by time, ID, or relevance and often changes.

---

### Keyset Pagination

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE created_at < '2024-03-01T00:00:00Z'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

Instead of offsetting by row number, you paginate **by value** — often a sort key like a timestamp or ID.

⚡️ Benefits:
- Extremely fast
- No performance degradation on deep pages
- Resistant to deletion/insertion issues

🧠 Downside: Can’t skip directly to page N. No total count.

📈 Used by: Facebook, Twitter, and high-performance feeds

## Schema Design for Pagination

A good paginated API should always include:
- `items`: the data
- `meta`: pagination metadata

Example:

```json
{
  "items": [...],
  "meta": {
    "totalCount": 1349,
    "page": 2,
    "pageSize": 50,
    "nextCursor": "abc123",
    "hasMore": true
  }
}
```

In GraphQL:

```graphql
query {
  products(first: 20, after: "abc123") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
      }
      cursor
    }
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-World Pagination Examples

### GitHub

GraphQL API uses cursor-based pagination (`edges`, `pageInfo`) — critical for repositories with 100K+ issues. The cursor structure is opaque, reducing coupling between client/server.

### Twitter

Internally uses keyset pagination with message IDs to paginate tweets, ensuring consistency even as tweets are deleted or new ones added between requests.

### Shopify

Product, collection, and order listings use cursor-based APIs. Admin dashboards show paginated tables, while public storefronts often use infinite scrolling with cached cursors.

---

## Frontend Considerations

- Use frameworks with **first-class support**: SWR, React Query, Relay, TanStack Query
- Implement **loading states** that don't block entire views
- Use intersection observers or scroll tracking for **infinite scroll**
- Track cursors in app state or URL params for resuming position
- Show **empty** states and **"end of list"** indicators clearly

---

## Pitfalls and Gotchas

- Offset + deletions = skipped or duplicated data
- Exposing raw DB IDs = security leak
- Changing sort order between requests = broken pagination
- Not handling network failures = frozen UI
- Mixing filters/sorts without resetting pagination = corrupted UX

💡 Rule of Thumb: Pagination must be **idempotent and stateless** per request.

---

## Conclusion: Paginate with Purpose

Pagination isn’t just about UX — it’s a **core API design principle**. Good pagination:
- Protects backend systems
- Enables infinite scaling
- Empowers frontend teams
- Reduces user frustration

Design it with care. Test it at scale. Communicate it in your docs.

And always remember: no one wants to scroll past the first 500 results anyway.
