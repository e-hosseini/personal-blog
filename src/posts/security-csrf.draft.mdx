# CSRF — Cross-Site Request Forgery Explained

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is a subtle, yet dangerous attack that targets user **actions**, not just input.

It works like this:
- You’re logged into a banking site
- You visit a malicious site in another tab
- That site sends a **forged request** to your bank — using your session cookies
- The bank executes the request because it’s from a “logged-in” user

That’s CSRF — and it’s exploited more often than you’d think.

---

## Real-World Example

### The Samy Worm (again)

Samy’s MySpace worm from the XSS example? It also included CSRF:
- Logged-in users' credentials were used to auto-friend Samy
- The browser sent valid MySpace cookies with the request
- MySpace had no CSRF protection — the POST worked

Result: over 1 million users were affected in 24 hours.

---

## What Makes CSRF Possible?

- **Session cookies** are automatically sent by the browser with requests
- Malicious pages can trigger:
  - `<img src="https://bank.com/transfer?amount=10000">`
  - `<form method="POST" action="https://bank.com/transfer">`

Even though these pages are **not from the same origin**, the cookies are included.

---

## Common CSRF Vectors

- HTML forms
- Image tags
- Hidden iframes
- XHR/fetch with bad CORS config
- Auto-submitting JS payloads

---

## Defending Against CSRF

### 1. CSRF Tokens

Generate a **random token** server-side and include it in all state-changing requests.

```html
<form action="/update-email" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="a7bcf90..." />
</form>
```

The server checks that:
- The token exists
- It matches the session/user
- It’s not expired

### 2. SameSite Cookies

Set your cookies like:

```
Set-Cookie: session=abc; SameSite=Lax; Secure
```

- `SameSite=Strict`: Only sends cookie from same-origin
- `SameSite=Lax`: Sends on top-level GET (safe for most sites)
- `SameSite=None`: Only used with `Secure` and cross-origin APIs

This blocks most drive-by form/image CSRF attacks.

### 3. Check Origin and Referer Headers

Only allow state changes if:

```http
Origin: https://yourdomain.com
Referer: https://yourdomain.com/settings
```

This mitigates CSRF in cases where tokens aren't available.

## CSRF in SPAs and APIs

SPAs often use tokens (JWT) instead of cookies — which makes CSRF **less of an issue**.

However:
- If your SPA uses **cookie-based auth**, you still need CSRF protection
- Combine **SameSite cookies** with **CSRF headers or tokens**

---

## CSRF in the Wild

### GitHub

- Uses CSRF tokens on all non-GET forms and AJAX calls
- Enforces `SameSite=Lax` on session cookies

### Django

- Automatic CSRF token injection in templates
- Middleware to reject requests without valid token

### Stripe Dashboard

- Authenticated dashboards with strict CSRF controls on all POSTs

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Accepting all POST/PUT/DELETE without origin check
- Storing auth tokens in cookies with `SameSite=None` and no CSRF token
- Not validating CSRF token expiration
- Misconfiguring CORS to allow credentials from `*`

---

## Testing CSRF

Use tools like:
- Burp Suite
- Postman (manually forge requests)
- Tamper Chrome
- OWASP ZAP

Try to:
- Submit a POST without the correct token
- Change cookie origin and replay requests
- Upload an iframe that performs a destructive action

---

## Conclusion: Authenticate the Intent

XSS hijacks user **input**. CSRF hijacks their **actions**.

Make sure that every sensitive POST, PUT, or DELETE:
- Comes from your domain
- Has an intent-verifying token
- Fails safely if tampered

Because security isn’t just about what users say — it’s about what they meant to say.
