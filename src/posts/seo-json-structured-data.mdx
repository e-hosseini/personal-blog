# Structured Data with JSON-LD — Speak the Language of Search

Search engines are more advanced than ever, but they still rely on structured clues to understand what your page is about. That’s where **structured data** comes in.

Structured data allows you to describe your content using a machine-readable format — typically **JSON-LD** (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data). Google, Bing, and other search engines can use this information to:
- Improve search result visibility
- Display **rich snippets** (stars, prices, author info)
- Power special features like **FAQs**, **recipes**, **events**, and more

---

## Why Use Structured Data?

- It improves **SEO visibility**
- Helps pages appear in **Google’s special features**
- Enables **voice search**, **Google Assistant**, and **SERP enhancements**
- Makes your content **clearer to crawlers**

It doesn’t directly increase your rankings, but it **enhances click-through rates (CTR)** by improving how you appear in search.

---

## What Is JSON-LD?

JSON-LD is the **preferred format by Google** because:
- It’s **non-intrusive**
- Easy to manage
- Can be placed anywhere in the document (typically in `<head>`)

You don’t have to modify existing HTML elements like with microdata or RDFa.

## Basic Example — Blog Post

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Mastering Structured Data for SEO",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Sam Dev"
  },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "GreatFrontend",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://example.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "datePublished": "2024-01-10",
  "image": "https://example.com/post-banner.jpg"
}
</script>
```

---

## Common Schema Types

- `Article`, `BlogPosting`
- `Product`, `Offer`, `AggregateRating`
- `FAQPage`, `HowTo`, `Recipe`
- `Organization`, `WebSite`, `BreadcrumbList`
- `Event`, `LocalBusiness`

Browse all options at [schema.org](https://schema.org)

## Implementing in React / Next.js

```tsx
import Head from 'next/head';

<Head>
  <script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: JSON.stringify({
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "Product",
      "name": "DevPro Hoodie",
      "description": "High-performance hoodie for developers",
      "brand": "DevStyle",
      "offers": {
        "@type": "Offer",
        "price": "49.99",
        "priceCurrency": "USD",
        "availability": "https://schema.org/InStock"
      }
    })
  }} />
</Head>
```

---

## How Google Uses It

- Powers **FAQ dropdowns**
- Shows **price and availability** for products
- Displays **ratings and reviews**
- Enhances **breadcrumbs**
- Enables **Google Shopping**, **News**, and **Discover**

---

## Validation Tools

- [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Schema Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/)
- Chrome DevTools → Inspect → Elements → `<script type="application/ld+json">`

---

## Real-World Examples

### Amazon

- Structured data for price, stock, brand, ratings
- Rich previews in Google search

### Eventbrite

- Event schema for title, time, location
- Enables carousel display for upcoming events

### Medium

- BlogPosting schema for articles
- Displays author info, publication date, and image in search

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Adding structured data **without visible content** (violates guidelines)
- Incorrect or outdated schema versions
- Mixing different formats (use JSON-LD only)
- Copy-paste schema from other sites without customizing

---

## Conclusion: Make Your Content Legible to Machines

Structured data is **like subtitles for your content** — it lets search engines “read between the lines.”

Used properly, it improves how you're indexed, presented, and discovered.

So start speaking their language.

And let the bots tell your story — clearly, concisely, and with all the context they need.
