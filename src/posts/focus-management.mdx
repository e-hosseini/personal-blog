# Focus Management — Guiding Users, One Tab at a Time

Focus is how users interact with your app — **especially when they can’t use a mouse**.

If you don’t manage focus, your app can:
- Confuse keyboard users
- Lock screen reader users in dead ends
- Break form flows
- Create inaccessible modals, menus, and widgets

In this article, you’ll learn:
- What focus is and how it behaves
- Tab order and focus indicators
- Managing focus in React and SPAs
- Creating focus traps and restoring focus context
- Testing strategies and common pitfalls

## What Is Focus?

In HTML, **focus** is the element that currently receives keyboard input.

Only one element can be focused at a time.

Focusable elements:
- `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`
- `<a href>`
- `[tabindex="0"]`
- Elements made programmatically focusable (`element.focus()`)

---

## The Tab Order

Pressing `Tab` cycles forward.  
`Shift + Tab` cycles backward.

Order is determined by:
1. Source order (top to bottom)
2. `tabindex` (0 = normal, >0 = custom order, -1 = programmatic only)

Avoid `tabindex > 0` — it overrides natural flow and breaks expectations.

---

## Focus Indicators

Browsers provide **focus rings** by default (blue outline on Chrome, dotted line in Firefox).

Do not remove them:

```css
button:focus {
  outline: none; /* ❌ */
}
```

Instead, customize them:

```css
button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid #00f;
}
```

Use `:focus-visible` to only show outlines for keyboard users (not mouse clicks).

---

## Managing Focus in SPAs

When routing changes or modals open, shift focus manually:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  document.getElementById("page-title").focus();
}, [location.pathname]);
```

Use `role="region"` and `tabindex="-1"` on main content regions to allow focus:

```html
<main id="main" tabindex="-1">...</main>
```

---

## Focus Traps

In dialogs or modals, keep focus **inside** the overlay.

### Libraries:
- `focus-trap` (npm)
- `react-focus-lock`
- `@reach/dialog`

Manual trap example:

```js
const handleKeyDown = (e) => {
  if (e.key === "Tab") {
    // Check if focus is leaving modal bounds
    // Cycle back to first/last element
  }
};
```

---

## Restore Focus on Close

Remember where the user was before opening a modal:

```tsx
const previouslyFocused = document.activeElement;

openModal();

modalClose(() => {
  previouslyFocused.focus();
});
```

This preserves context — a crucial UX practice for keyboard users.

---

## Skip Links

Provide a “Skip to Content” link at the top of the page:

```html
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
```

Make it visible on focus:

```css
.skip-link {
  position: absolute;
  left: -9999px;
}
.skip-link:focus {
  left: 0;
}
```

---

## Real-World Examples

### GOV.UK

- Manages focus on every route change
- Prominent skip links and heading focus management

### GitHub

- Focus returns to previous control when dropdowns, modals close
- `aria-activedescendant` for combobox navigation

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Removing focus outlines with no alternative
- Opening modals without focus
- Not returning focus after closing popups
- Setting `tabindex="0"` everywhere
- Making hidden elements focusable

---

## Testing Focus

- Navigate with keyboard only
- Use Axe DevTools or Lighthouse
- Check visual focus indicator
- Try screen reader navigation with NVDA or VoiceOver

---

## Conclusion: Accessibility Begins with Focus

If users can’t focus on it, they can’t use it.

Focus isn’t just a state — it’s a **conversation** between your interface and your user.

So guide that conversation gently. Be clear, be predictable, and **keep them grounded**.

Because accessible apps don’t just work — they **stay in focus**.
