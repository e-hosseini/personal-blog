# Preloading and Prefetching — Speeding Up What Comes Next

Speed isn’t just about rendering fast — it’s about **being ready before the user asks**. That’s the goal of **preloading** and **prefetching**.

These two techniques allow you to **fetch critical resources in advance**, so when the user navigates, interacts, or scrolls, the content appears instantly.

They’re especially powerful in SPAs (single-page apps), where the first page is fast, but transitions between views can stall due to JS or data fetches.

In this article, we’ll cover:
- The difference between preload and prefetch
- When and how to use them
- Practical examples with JavaScript, CSS, images, and data
- React-specific strategies
- Common pitfalls and best practices

## The Problem: First Clicks Are Fast, The Rest Lag

You’ve optimized your initial load. Lighthouse scores are green. But the moment the user clicks “Dashboard,” there’s a pause — new JS chunks are loading.

This is the **SPA trap**: great first paint, bad navigations.

Solution? Load next steps **before they’re needed**.

## Preload vs Prefetch: What’s the Difference?

| Feature   | Preload                         | Prefetch                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Priority  | High                             | Low                               |
| When      | During page load                 | When idle                         |
| Use Case  | Needed soon (e.g. font, CSS)     | Might be needed later (e.g. route)|
| Tag       | `<link rel="preload">`           | `<link rel="prefetch">`           |

Think of **preload** as "I'm going to need this immediately", and **prefetch** as "I might need this soon".

## Preloading Critical Resources

### Fonts

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

This ensures font is downloaded **before paint**, improving LCP.

### JavaScript

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/static/js/dashboard.chunk.js" as="script">
```

Only preload if JS is **guaranteed to be used soon** (e.g., main view).

---

## Prefetching Anticipated Routes

Use this to speed up future navigation.

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="/static/js/settings.chunk.js" as="script">
```

Most modern frameworks like **Next.js**, **React Router**, or **Gatsby** prefetch on hover or idle.

### React Router + Prefetch on Hover

```tsx
<Link to="/dashboard" onMouseEnter={() => import("./Dashboard")} />
```

Prefetches the JS chunk before the click.

---

## Data Prefetching

Combine with SWR or React Query:

```tsx
const queryClient = useQueryClient();
queryClient.prefetchQuery(["dashboardData"], fetchDashboard);
```

Ideal for authenticated dashboards, profile pages, etc.

---

## Framework-Level Support

### Next.js

- `next/link` prefetches pages on hover/idle
- `getStaticProps` + ISR allow stale-while-revalidate caching

### Remix

- `loader()` fetches per route
- Prefetches HTML/data chunks before navigation

### Astro

- Preloads critical scripts statically
- Minimal runtime JS for pre-hydration

---

## Use Cases

- Hovering on a menu → prefetch route
- First scroll → preload next viewport images
- Idle time after TTI → preload dashboard JS
- Page load → preload auth/session tokens

---

## Real-World Examples

### GitHub

- Prefetches repository and issue data on hover
- Loads PR diff assets before open

### YouTube

- Preloads next video assets
- Prefetches thumbnails + metadata for recommended items

### Amazon

- Prefetches product JSON + carousel scripts based on scroll intent

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Preloading too much → blocks critical path
- Prefetching immediately → clogs bandwidth
- Forgetting `as` attribute → hint ignored
- Prefetching large resources on mobile (watch your data budget)

---

## Conclusion: Get There Before the User Does

Preloading and prefetching let you **cheat latency**.

They make your app feel fast — not by being faster, but by being **ready**.

Done right, they blur the line between intention and delivery.

Because the fastest request is one that never needed to wait.
