# WebSockets — Full-Duplex Real-Time Communication at Scale

WebSockets are the **gold standard** for real-time communication in modern web applications.

Unlike HTTP, which is request-response by nature, WebSockets establish a **persistent, bidirectional connection** between the client and server. Messages can flow in **both directions** at any time — without re-establishing the connection or waiting for a response.

This makes WebSockets the ideal transport for:
- Chat applications
- Multiplayer games
- Collaborative editing tools (like Figma or Google Docs)
- Stock tickers, sports scores, real-time auctions
- Live dashboards, telemetry streams, and control systems

In this chapter, we’ll cover the **mechanics, architecture, and scalability concerns** of using WebSockets at scale.

---

## How WebSockets Work

WebSockets start with an HTTP request using the `Upgrade` header:

```http
GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
```

Once accepted, the connection **upgrades** from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol, establishing a persistent TCP connection.

From there:
- Both client and server can send messages
- Messages are framed using a binary/text protocol
- The connection stays alive until closed

---

## Example: WebSocket Client (Browser)

```js
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://example.com/ws");

socket.onopen = () => {
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "join", room: "123" }));
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log("New message:", data);
};

socket.onclose = () => {
  console.log("Socket closed");
};
```

This creates a **live pipe** between the browser and backend — perfect for low-latency messaging.

---

## Server Implementation (Node.js / ws)

```js
const WebSocket = require("ws");
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "welcome" }));

  ws.on("message", (msg) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(msg);
    console.log("Received:", data);
  });
});
```

WebSocket servers can push messages to connected clients **at any time**, enabling features that polling and SSE can’t match.

---

## Use Cases

- **Chat**: Send/receive messages instantly with minimal latency
- **Games**: Coordinate movements, states, actions in real-time
- **Collaborative Editing**: Share cursors, selections, changes live
- **Live Trading**: Deliver stock ticks, forex updates, trades
- **IoT & Monitoring**: Stream metrics and sensor data continuously

## WebSockets vs Polling vs SSE

| Feature             | WebSocket        | SSE               | Polling        |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Direction            | Bi-directional   | Server → Client    | Client → Server |
| Connection           | Persistent       | Persistent         | Repeated       |
| Latency              | ⚡ Instant        | ⚡ Fast             | ⚠️ Delayed     |
| Proxy Friendly       | ⚠️ Sometimes      | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes         |
| Binary Support       | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No               | ❌ No          |
| Built-in Browser API | ✅ Yes (WebSocket)| ✅ Yes (EventSource)| ✅ fetch()     |

## Scaling WebSockets

This is where things get real.

WebSockets are **stateful** and **persistent**, which makes them harder to scale than stateless REST APIs.

Strategies:
- Use load balancers with sticky sessions (IP hash, cookie affinity)
- Deploy a message broker (Redis pub/sub, Kafka, NATS) to broadcast messages across nodes
- Use cloud-native WebSocket gateways (AWS API Gateway, Azure SignalR, Socket.IO adapters)
- Separate WebSocket servers from core API servers

Popular libraries:
- `ws`, `uWebSockets.js` (Node.js)
- `Socket.IO` (event-based wrapper)
- `Phoenix Channels` (Elixir)
- `Gorilla WebSocket`, `FastWS` (Go)

---

## WebSocket Security

- Use `wss://` (TLS-secured)
- Authenticate on connect (`token` in URL or initial message)
- Use a short TTL or heartbeat (ping/pong) to detect idle clients
- Throttle/bucket requests from abusive clients
- Sanitize payloads — don’t trust incoming data blindly

---

## Heartbeats and Reconnection

WebSocket clients should detect dead connections and auto-reconnect.

Use `ping`/`pong` packets or application-level heartbeats (every 15–30s):

```js
setInterval(() => socket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "ping" })), 15000);
```

Backend should respond or terminate stale sockets.

---

## Real-World Usage

### Slack

Uses WebSockets for messaging, presence, typing indicators, and more. Fall back to polling only when strictly necessary.

### Figma

Real-time design collaboration is powered by a distributed WebSocket grid with internal CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types).

### Binance / Coinbase

Streaming market data, order books, and trade events via WebSockets for traders and bots.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using WebSockets when SSE or polling is sufficient
- Holding too many unused sockets open
- Relying on global variables in multithreaded WebSocket servers
- Trusting clients without validating messages
- Not separating message transport from business logic

---

## Conclusion: Build for Real-Time, at Real Scale

WebSockets unlock true interactivity — but they require planning, testing, and architectural thoughtfulness.

Used well, they feel magical.

Used poorly, they become a source of instability and pain.

Choose WebSockets when the cost is justified — and when **real-time isn’t just a feature**, but a necessity.

Because when every millisecond matters, there’s no substitute.
