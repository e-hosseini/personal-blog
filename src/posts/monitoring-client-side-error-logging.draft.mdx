# Client-Side Error Logging — Capture What Crashes in the Wild

When your frontend crashes, users rarely send you an email about it. They just leave.

**Client-side error logging** ensures you know what went wrong — from real browsers, devices, and users.

It captures runtime JavaScript issues like:
- Uncaught exceptions
- Promise rejections
- Resource load failures
- Runtime errors triggered by APIs, third parties, or UI actions

Without this visibility, your production app is a black box.

---

## Why Log Errors from the Client?

### Bugs in Production ≠ Bugs in Dev

- Dev environments are clean, fast, modern
- Real users run on laggy networks, outdated browsers, low-end devices
- Real-world issues don’t show up in QA

Client-side logging reveals:
- Unknown edge cases
- Silent failures
- Broken 3rd party scripts
- Framework-specific runtime errors

---

## What to Capture

1. **Uncaught Errors**
   - Via `window.onerror`
   - Syntax/runtime exceptions

2. **Unhandled Promise Rejections**
   - Via `window.onunhandledrejection`
   - Catch async issues

3. **Resource Failures**
   - `<img onerror>`, script load errors
   - CDN issues, typoed paths

4. **Stack Traces**
   - Minified or sourcemapped
   - Line/column numbers

5. **User Context**
   - OS, browser, device
   - Route/page/component
   - Clicks before error

---

## Minimal Example

```js
window.onerror = function (message, source, lineno, colno, error) {
  sendToBackend({
    type: 'error',
    message,
    stack: error?.stack,
    source,
    lineno,
    colno
  });
};

window.onunhandledrejection = function (event) {
  sendToBackend({
    type: 'promise',
    reason: event.reason,
    stack: event.reason?.stack
  });
};
```

---

## Enhancing with Framework Hooks

### React

Use an error boundary:

```tsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    logError({ error, info });
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

### Vue

```js
app.config.errorHandler = (err, vm, info) => {
  sendToLoggingService({ err, info });
};
```

---

## Sending Logs to the Backend

Use:
- `fetch()` or `navigator.sendBeacon()` for async dispatch
- Batched log uploads for performance
- JSON with browser metadata

Store in:
- Your own logging endpoint
- External tools (Sentry, LogRocket, Bugsnag)

---

## Sourcemaps = Real Debuggability

Minified errors are unreadable:

```text
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined at main.min.js:1:9243
```

Upload sourcemaps to your logging tool or server, so you can get:

```text
TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
  at ProductCard.tsx:45:12
```

---

## Real-World Use: Sentry

- Tracks `onerror`, `onunhandledrejection`
- Resolves sourcemaps automatically
- Groups duplicate errors
- Shows affected users, devices, browsers

### Other tools:
- Bugsnag
- LogRocket
- Raygun
- TrackJS

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Logging without batching (too many requests)
- Missing sourcemaps
- Not including user context (page, action)
- Silencing all errors (`try/catch` without rethrow)
- Logging to `console.log` only (not persisted)

---

## Conclusion: Capture the Chaos

You can't fix what you don't see.

Client-side error logging turns invisible crashes into actionable insights. It catches:
- Real bugs
- Real users
- Real stacks

So you can ship with confidence — not just hope.
