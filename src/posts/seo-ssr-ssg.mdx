# SSR & SSG for SEO — Rendering for Discoverability

Search engines can index JavaScript-heavy SPAs — **but not always well**.

Modern web apps often render content client-side. That means:
- The initial HTML is nearly empty
- Crawlers need to wait for JS to load and execute
- Some pages might be **missed or misindexed**

To solve this, we use **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering) or **SSG** (Static Site Generation) — both of which generate **HTML at build time or request time**, making your content immediately available for bots.

In this article:
- What SSR and SSG are
- How they improve SEO
- When to use one over the other
- Framework examples (Next.js, Astro, Nuxt)
- Common pitfalls and best practices

## Why Client-Side Rendering Hurts SEO

- Googlebot renders JS, but slowly and inconsistently
- Social media crawlers (Slack, LinkedIn) often **don’t execute JS**
- Empty `<div id="root">` is a missed opportunity
- Dynamic content might load too late to be indexed

## SSR vs SSG — What’s the Difference?

| Feature      | SSR (Server Side Rendering)       | SSG (Static Site Generation)   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| When Rendered | On request (per user)             | At build time (once)           |
| SEO Friendly | ✅ Yes                             | ✅ Yes                          |
| Use Case     | Dynamic content, user-specific    | Blogs, docs, mostly-static     |
| Example      | Product page with live price      | Marketing homepage             |

## Next.js Example

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const posts = await fetchPosts();
  return { props: { posts } };
}
```

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

```tsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetchData(context.params.id);
  return { props: { data } };
}
```

Both will pre-render the page to HTML, ready for search engines.

---

## Astro & SvelteKit

### Astro

- All pages are SSG by default
- Great for content-heavy sites

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  return [{ params: { slug: "seo-guide" } }];
}
```

### SvelteKit

- Choose SSR, SSG, or hybrid per route

```ts
export const prerender = true; // Enables SSG
```

---

## Benefits for SEO

- Immediate content in HTML
- Faster **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**
- Better support for crawlers and link previews
- Higher Core Web Vitals scores (especially LCP)
- Greater control over meta tags, structured data, canonical links

---

## Common Pitfalls

- SSR pages without caching (slower, costly)
- SSG builds that forget new pages (stale sitemap)
- Improper `<head>` metadata (missing title/meta on SSR)
- No loading states = broken UX for slow loads
- Forgetting to update canonical URLs for dynamic pages

---

## Real-World Examples

### Vercel.com

- Next.js with hybrid SSR/SSG
- Content pages are statically generated
- Dashboard and auth are SSR

### Notion.dev

- Docs pre-rendered with Astro
- Loads instantly with crawlable HTML

---

## Bonus: ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

Available in Next.js and others:

```tsx
export async function getStaticProps() {
  return {
    props: {},
    revalidate: 60 // Regenerate every 60 seconds
  }
}
```

Best of both worlds: static performance + dynamic freshness.

## Conclusion: Render for Robots

SSR and SSG let you serve content the way search engines prefer: fast, clear, and complete.

Don’t leave your pages blank and expect crawlers to figure it out.

Render once. Reuse often. And make your content visible the moment the page loads.

Because the best SEO isn’t magic — it’s **good engineering**.
