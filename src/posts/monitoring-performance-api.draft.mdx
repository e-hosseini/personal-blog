# Performance API — Measuring with Precision in the Browser

If you're serious about web performance, you need more than a stopwatch.

The **Performance API** is a suite of browser interfaces that let you measure:
- Navigation start to content load
- Resource load timings (scripts, images, fonts)
- Custom user events and spans
- Key web vitals (like LCP, FCP, TTFB)

It’s a cornerstone of **Real User Monitoring (RUM)** and a low-level tool for **custom instrumentation**.

---

## Key Components of the Performance API

### 1. Navigation Timing

Gives precise timestamps from page load lifecycle:

```js
const nav = performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")[0];
console.log("Time to Interactive:", nav.domInteractive);
```

Metrics include:
- `domInteractive`
- `domContentLoadedEventEnd`
- `loadEventEnd`
- `redirectStart`, `redirectEnd`
- `responseStart`, `responseEnd`
- `fetchStart`

---

### 2. Resource Timing

Tracks how long each resource took to load:

```js
const entries = performance.getEntriesByType("resource");
entries.forEach(res => {
  console.log(res.name, res.duration);
});
```

Metrics include:
- Resource fetch time
- DNS, TCP, and SSL breakdowns
- Connection reuse

Useful for identifying:
- Slow images or fonts
- Blocking JS scripts
- Long-running fetches

---

### 3. Paint Timing

For initial render:

```js
const paints = performance.getEntriesByType("paint");
paints.forEach(p => console.log(p.name, p.startTime));
```

Includes:
- `first-paint`
- `first-contentful-paint` (FCP)

These feed into metrics like Web Vitals.

---

### 4. Long Tasks (PerformanceObserver)

Catch tasks > 50ms that block the main thread:

```js
new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    console.log("Long Task:", entry);
  }
}).observe({ type: "longtask", buffered: true });
```

Ideal for identifying jank, layout thrashing, and event blocking.

---

### 5. Custom Marks and Measures

Add your own spans:

```js
performance.mark("start-api-call");

// later...
performance.mark("end-api-call");
performance.measure("api-duration", "start-api-call", "end-api-call");
```

Great for:
- Page transitions
- React hydration
- Form submissions
- Button click → response time

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Google

- Web Vitals built on top of Performance API
- Chrome's Lighthouse + CrUX rely on these metrics

### Shopify

- Tracks React hydration and LCP via marks
- Collects metrics for storefront dashboard visibility

### Airbnb

- Uses resource timing to detect slow-loading critical assets
- Correlates with CDN performance

---

## Tools Built on Performance API

- `web-vitals` (Google)
- `perfume.js`
- RUM dashboards (Vercel, Calibre)
- Custom logging via `navigator.sendBeacon`

---

## Best Practices

- Use `PerformanceObserver` for async metrics
- Batch and buffer logs before sending
- Use high-resolution `performance.now()` for relative timing
- Combine with user context (device, route, interaction)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Measuring performance only in dev mode
- Ignoring long tasks
- Over-measuring (log spam, perf degradation)
- Relying solely on `Date.now()` (not high-res)

---

## Conclusion: Know What, When, and Why

The Performance API gives you **developer-grade instrumentation** for user experience.

It helps answer questions like:
- Why did this route feel slow?
- Which resources delayed the page?
- What blocked interaction?

It’s the core of field data — and it’s in your browser, ready to help.
