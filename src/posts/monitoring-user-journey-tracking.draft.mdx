# User Journey Tracking — From First Click to Final Action

You know your user signed up. But how did they get there?

Which pages did they view? What confused them? Where did they drop off?

**User journey tracking** answers these questions by capturing how people move through your product — not just what they do, but **in what order**, and **why it matters**.

It’s about connecting:
- Page views
- Interactions
- Events
- Time and context

To tell the story of **each user session** — and use that to build better products.

---

## Why Track User Journeys?

- Understand onboarding flows
- Spot conversion drop-offs
- Investigate rage clicks and churn patterns
- Correlate UX with revenue
- Improve path-based A/B testing

User journeys show **intent and friction**, not just outcomes.

---

## How It Works

### Session Identification

Each session has:
- Unique session ID
- Timestamps
- Optional user ID (if authenticated)

### Event Logging

Capture:
- Page views
- Button clicks
- Search usage
- Form submissions
- Scrolls or hovers

### Metadata

Include:
- URL, title, referrer
- Browser, OS, device
- Custom app state (e.g. cart count, auth status)

---

## Tools for Tracking Journeys

- **Segment + Amplitude** — capture → transform → analyze
- **Mixpanel** — funnels and event tracking
- **PostHog** — self-hosted analytics and path tracking
- **Heap** — auto-captures click paths and UI events
- **LogRocket / FullStory** — session replays + interaction logs

---

## Custom Implementation

```js
function trackEvent(name, metadata = {}) {
  sendToBackend({
    type: "event",
    name,
    metadata,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    sessionId: getSessionId()
  });
}
```

### Use Example

```js
trackEvent("page_view", { path: "/pricing" });
trackEvent("clicked_start_trial");
trackEvent("signup_completed");
```

Now you can analyze journeys like:

```
Landing Page → Pricing → Start Trial → Signup → Dashboard
```

---

## Visualizing Journeys

- Sankey charts (paths)
- Funnels (conversion analysis)
- Heatmaps (attention focus)
- Session replays (context)

Use to answer:
- Where do users stall?
- What paths lead to conversion?
- Which flows show rage clicking?

---

## Real-World Examples

### Netflix

- Tracks navigation to identify friction (e.g. “where users stall before playback”)
- A/B tests based on journey segments

### Spotify

- Logs listening session flows
- Tracks onboarding and interaction across platforms

### Notion

- Measures path to first note/document
- Optimizes onboarding with journey maps

## Privacy and Consent

- Mask sensitive fields (email, passwords)
- Obfuscate personal data
- Ask for consent (GDPR/CCPA)
- Log generic interactions, not raw keystrokes

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Capturing too little (can’t see full picture)
- Capturing too much (privacy nightmare)
- No session ID or timestamp
- Logging without consistent taxonomy (e.g. "Signup" vs "sign_up" vs "Sign-Up")

---

## Conclusion: Know the Path, Improve the Product

Your users don’t just land and click.

They explore. They compare. They bounce, retry, succeed — or churn.

User journey tracking gives you **clarity**:
- What works
- What breaks
- What drives value

It’s not just analytics — it’s **understanding intent**.

And that’s how you design better experiences.
