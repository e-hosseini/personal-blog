# Partial Hydration ‚Äî Optimizing Interactivity One Component at a Time

Hydration is the hidden tax of server-rendered web apps. It turns a fast-loading HTML page into a fully interactive React (or Vue, or Svelte) app ‚Äî but it does so by downloading and executing JavaScript for **every component** on the page. For large apps, that‚Äôs a problem.

**Partial hydration** is one of the most important ‚Äî and least understood ‚Äî performance patterns in frontend architecture. It brings nuance to hydration, by **activating only the parts of the page that need interactivity**, leaving everything else static.

The result? Faster load times, leaner bundles, and a smarter way to balance performance with dynamic UI.

## Why Was Partial Hydration Invented?

In the early days of SSR, hydration was all-or-nothing: the whole app would rehydrate regardless of what needed to be interactive. This worked fine for small pages. But as teams scaled up and components multiplied, full hydration became a bottleneck ‚Äî especially on mobile.

Partial hydration emerged as a solution: what if we could render the whole page as HTML, then selectively hydrate only the pieces that **require** interactivity?

This idea was independently explored by teams at Google (AMP), Netflix, eBay (Marko), and later adopted more formally by frameworks like Astro, Qwik, and Preact.

---

## How It Works

In a partial hydration model:
1. The entire page is rendered server-side into static HTML
2. Only **certain components** include the code to be hydrated
3. Those components are **bootstrapped on demand**, not upfront

```tsx
<StaticHeader />
<HydratedSearchBox client:idle />
<StaticArticle />
<InteractiveComments client:visible />
```

In Astro and Marko, this is supported natively. In React, it's possible via code splitting + lazy loading + dynamic import + visibility logic (though not natively supported at the framework level ‚Äî yet).

---

## Frameworks That Support It

- **Astro** ‚Äì via `client:*` directives
- **Qwik** ‚Äì built entirely around partial, resumable hydration
- **Marko** ‚Äì pioneered the concept with fine-grained control
- **Preact** ‚Äì with islands + `hydrate()` support
- **React** ‚Äì can simulate partial hydration with Suspense + lazy + custom logic

## Real-World Applications

### eBay

eBay‚Äôs Marko framework uses partial hydration to render large catalog pages and only hydrate interactive elements like add-to-cart buttons, login dropdowns, and filters. This drastically reduces JS sent to the client.

### Google Search (AMP)

AMP pages use a version of partial hydration by allowing only certain ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù to be interactive (like carousels or ads), while leaving the rest purely HTML.

### Shopify Hydrogen

Hydrogen allows developers to wrap client-interactive widgets (like cart buttons or selectors) and hydrate only those widgets inside an otherwise server-rendered product page.

## Benefits

- üîã Reduced JavaScript payload
- ‚ö° Faster Time to Interactive (TTI)
- üåç Better battery usage and CPU efficiency
- üìà Improved Core Web Vitals
- ‚úÖ Maintains full server-rendered HTML output (SEO-friendly)

Partial hydration scales particularly well on:
- Product detail pages
- Long-form content sites
- E-commerce listings
- Documentation sites
- Enterprise dashboards with static shell and live widgets

---

## Limitations and Considerations

- Harder to implement manually in React (no built-in API)
- Component boundaries must be clear and isolated
- State management can get tricky across static/interactive boundaries
- Increased architectural complexity without the right tooling

Some frameworks (like Qwik and Astro) eliminate these problems by making partial hydration the default ‚Äî which is arguably the future.

## Conclusion: The Right JavaScript in the Right Place

Partial hydration isn‚Äôt about less JavaScript. It‚Äôs about **the right JavaScript in the right place**. It brings intelligence and granularity to hydration, helping teams ship faster apps without compromising on interactivity.

Used wisely, partial hydration can help modern teams ship pages that are **as fast as static sites** ‚Äî with the power of dynamic UIs, where and when they‚Äôre actually needed.

It‚Äôs a bridge between the old web and the modern one.

And it‚Äôs one of the smartest architectural decisions you can make.
