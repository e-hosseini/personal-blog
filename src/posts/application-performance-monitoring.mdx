# Application Performance Monitoring (APM): Achieving Full-Stack Visibility

In the contemporary landscape of software development, applications are no longer monolithic. They have evolved into complex distributed systems. Consider a simple user interaction like a button click. It may:
- Invoke an API hosted on a separate domain
- Query multiple databases to fetch data
- Pass through a myriad of CDNs, proxies, and caches

To gain a comprehensive understanding of performance across this intricate chain, we employ a concept known as **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**.

APM tools are powerful resources that assist developers and operations teams in the following ways:
- They enable tracing of user requests across multiple services
- They facilitate the measurement of backend latency and error rates
- They allow correlation of logs, metrics, and traces
- They aid in diagnosing system slowdowns and outages

In essence, APM brings backend observability to the **frontend-aware engineer**.

## The Breadth of APM Monitoring

APM tools function by weaving together telemetry from various sources such as:
- HTTP request latency: Measures the time it takes for an HTTP request to be fulfilled
- Database queries and timing: Keeps track of the queries made and the time taken to execute each query
- Cache usage and misses: Monitors the efficiency of cache usage and logs instances where data is not found in the cache, resulting in a miss
- Error rates and stack traces: Records the frequency of errors and keeps track of the call stack at the point where an exception was thrown
- Resource usage: Monitors the consumption of resources like CPU and memory

Some sophisticated tools also incorporate:
- User session traces: Provides visibility into user behavior during a session
- Frontend to backend span tracking: Tracks requests from frontend to backend
- Distributed transaction mapping: Helps visualize and understand distributed transactions

## Key Features of APM Tools

APM tools come packed with several essential features such as:
- Distributed Tracing: Provides visibility into requests as they traverse through various services
- Alerting and anomaly detection: Monitors metrics and sends alerts when anomalies are detected
- Performance dashboards: Presents a visual representation of application performance metrics
- Service maps and dependency graphs: Visualizes service dependencies to help understand system behavior
- Error tracking: Tracks and reports errors in the application
- Data retention and analytics: Stores and analyzes historical data to identify trends and patterns

## Real-World APM Examples

To understand how these tools function in a real-world setting, let’s delve into a few examples.

### Datadog APM

Datadog APM is a robust tool that offers:
- Distributed tracing with support for OpenTelemetry, a set of APIs, libraries, and instrumentation that standardizes the generation, collection, and description of telemetry data
- Flamegraphs that provide a visualization of service execution, helping identify bottlenecks
- Metrics and logs presented in the context of traces, providing comprehensive visibility

### New Relic

New Relic offers:
- Full-stack tracing, spanning from the browser to the backend and the database
- Monitoring of transaction times and external service tracking
- Custom dashboards featuring Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### Sentry Performance

Sentry Performance is a tool that:
- Focuses on frontend and API timing, providing insights into frontend performance and API response times
- Provides spans from user input to backend API response, offering end-to-end visibility
- Combines error tracking with performance monitoring to provide context

## Tracing Across Frontend and Backend

With the help of OpenTelemetry, you can track a full user journey as follows:

1. A button click triggers an API request
2. A Trace ID is added to the request headers
3. The backend carries the trace through its services
4. The final response is correlated with the frontend span

Here's a practical example of how this works:

Frontend:

```ts
fetch("/api/data", {
  headers: {
    "traceparent": "00-abc...-1234...-01"
  }
});
```

The JavaScript `fetch` function makes a request to "/api/data". The headers include a "traceparent" header, which carries the Trace ID.

Backend:

```go
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  span := tracer.StartSpanFromRequest(r)
  defer span.End()
  ...
}
```

In this Go code snippet, a new span is started from the incoming HTTP request, and it's ensured that the span ends when the function returns, using the `defer` keyword. This span carries the Trace ID through the backend services.

## Choosing the Right Tool

When it comes to selecting an APM tool, it's essential to consider the strengths of each:

| Tool        | Strength                         |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Datadog     | Enterprise scale, full tracing   |
| New Relic   | Deep backend profiling           |
| Sentry      | JavaScript and API tracing, with integrated error tracking |
| Lightstep   | Long-term trace retention        |
| Elastic APM | Integration with open-source stack|

## APM Anti-Patterns

Avoiding the following anti-patterns can significantly improve your APM practices:
- Logging without correlation IDs: Without correlation IDs, it's difficult to trace logs back to their original requests
- Only tracing the frontend or backend, not both: This provides an incomplete picture of your application's behavior
- Ignoring service latency in dashboards: Service latency can have a significant impact on user experience
- Not setting up alerting on critical user flows: This can lead to slow responses to issues affecting important user activities

---

## The Intersection of APM and Frontend Development

Frontend developers can greatly benefit from APM. It not only concerns servers but also helps answer critical questions such as:
- Why is the `/api/products` endpoint slow?
- Which database query is causing a bottleneck during checkout?
- Are failed logins related to authentication service latency?

APM tools help connect the dots between code and its consequence, providing a comprehensive view of the system.

## Conclusion: Trace It or Chase It

You can either trace the user journey — gaining insights and understanding the behavior of your application — or chase bug reports around your communication channels.

APM tools provide you with:
- Context: Understand the circumstances surrounding system behavior
- Timelines: See when specific events occur
- Causality: Determine the cause-and-effect relationship between events

And ultimately, they provide a better understanding of the reality of your application.

Because excellent performance is not just about speed — it's about **observability**. The ability to observe the inner workings of your system is crucial to maintaining and improving performance.
