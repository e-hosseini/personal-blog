# Keyboard Interactions & Shortcuts — Designing for the Real Web

The web isn’t just clicked — it’s **navigated**.

For millions of users, the mouse is not an option. They rely on **keyboard navigation** to interact with UIs. That includes:
- Screen reader users
- Users with motor disabilities
- Power users and developers
- People on custom hardware or limited environments

If your app can’t be used fully with a keyboard, it’s **not accessible**.

This article covers:
- Why keyboard support matters
- Tab navigation and focus order
- Implementing keyboard interactions (Enter, Escape, Arrows)
- Building shortcuts that enhance UX, not harm it
- Real-world keyboard patterns in accessible apps

# Conclusion: If You Can Tab to It, You Can Use It

Keyboard support is **fundamental**. It’s not a “nice-to-have.” It’s how many people access the web — and it powers speed, flexibility, and freedom for all users.

So tab through your UI.

Fix what breaks.

And build an experience that welcomes every kind of user — not just the ones holding a mouse.
