# Application Performance Monitoring (APM) — Full-Stack Visibility

Modern applications are distributed systems. A user’s tap on a button might:
- Hit an API on a different domain
- Query multiple databases
- Pass through CDNs, proxies, and caches

To understand performance across this chain, we need **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**.

APM tools help developers and ops teams:
- Trace user requests across services
- Measure backend latency and errors
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces
- Diagnose slowdowns and outages

APM brings backend observability to the **frontend-aware engineer**.

---

## What Does APM Track?

APM tools stitch together telemetry like:
- HTTP request latency
- Database queries and timing
- Cache usage and misses
- Error rates and stack traces
- Resource usage (CPU, memory)

Some tools also include:
- User session traces
- Frontend to backend span tracking
- Distributed transaction mapping

---

## Key Features of APM Tools

- Distributed Tracing
- Alerting and anomaly detection
- Performance dashboards
- Service maps and dependency graphs
- Error tracking
- Data retention and analytics

---

## Real-World APM Examples

### Datadog APM

- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry support
- Flamegraphs of service execution
- Metrics and logs in context of traces

### New Relic

- Full-stack tracing: browser → backend → DB
- Transaction times, external service tracking
- Custom dashboards with SLIs and SLOs

### Sentry Performance

- Focuses on frontend + API timing
- Spans from user input to backend API response
- Combines with error tracking for context

## Tracing Across Frontend and Backend

Using OpenTelemetry, you can track a full user journey:

1. Button click triggers an API request
2. Trace ID is added to request headers
3. Backend carries the trace through services
4. Final response is correlated with frontend span

Frontend:

```ts
fetch("/api/data", {
  headers: {
    "traceparent": "00-abc...-1234...-01"
  }
});
```

Backend:

```go
func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  span := tracer.StartSpanFromRequest(r)
  defer span.End()
  ...
}
```

## Choosing the Right Tool

| Tool        | Strength                         |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Datadog     | Enterprise scale, full tracing   |
| New Relic   | Deep backend profiling           |
| Sentry      | JS + API tracing + errors        |
| Lightstep   | Long-term trace retention        |
| Elastic APM | Open-source stack integration    |

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Logging without correlation IDs
- Only tracing frontend or backend, not both
- Ignoring service latency in dashboards
- No alerting on critical user flows

---

## APM + Frontend = Better UX

Frontend devs need APM too. It’s not just about servers:
- Why is `/api/products` slow?
- Which DB query is bottlenecking a checkout?
- Are failed logins tied to auth service latency?

APM connects the dots between code and consequence.

---

## Conclusion: Trace It or Chase It

You can either trace the user journey — or chase bug reports around Slack.

APM gives you:
- Context
- Timelines
- Causality

And ultimately, a better understanding of your app's reality.

Because good performance isn’t just fast — it’s **observable**.
