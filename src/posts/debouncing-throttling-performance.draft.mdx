# Debouncing & Throttling — Rate-Limiting the Frontend Like a Pro

Modern UIs are interactive, reactive, and — when left unchecked — overactive.

Scroll events fire every pixel. Inputs fire on every keystroke. Resize events hammer the DOM.

If you handle each one without control, you create **lag, frame drops, and wasted CPU cycles**.

The solution? **Debouncing** and **throttling** — simple, powerful strategies for **rate-limiting the frontend**.

In this guide, you’ll learn:
- The difference between debouncing and throttling
- How to use each to prevent render storms
- React-friendly implementations
- Real-world patterns (search, resize, scroll)
- Best practices and pitfalls to avoid

---

## Why Control Frequency?

Every time a user types, scrolls, clicks, or resizes:
- You may fire an event
- That may trigger a rerender
- Which may reflow/repaint
- Which may lag the UI

Uncontrolled = sluggish UX.

---

## Debouncing: Wait Until They’re Done

**Debounce** delays execution until the user **stops** doing something.

```js
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeout;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}
```

Use for:
- Search boxes
- Input validation
- Auto-saving drafts

---

## Throttling: Limit Frequency

**Throttle** ensures a function only runs once every N ms.

```js
function throttle(fn, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return (...args) => {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      fn(...args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
    }
  };
}
```

Use for:
- Scroll handling
- Resize tracking
- Analytics firing

---

## React Example — Debounce Input

```tsx
const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
const debouncedQuery = useDebounce(query, 300);

useEffect(() => {
  if (debouncedQuery) {
    fetch(`/search?q=${debouncedQuery}`);
  }
}, [debouncedQuery]);
```

Avoids fetch-on-every-keystroke chaos.

---

## Scroll Optimization with Throttle

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
    const scrollY = window.scrollY;
    // Maybe trigger lazy-load, sticky nav, etc.
  }, 100);

  window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);
}, []);
```

Results in buttery smooth UI even on long pages.

---

## Real-World Usage

- **Twitter**: Throttles scroll events to animate header/UI transitions
- **Gmail**: Debounces search box as-you-type queries
- **Spotify**: Throttles progress bar + waveform visualization
- **Stripe Dashboard**: Debounces input-driven reports & filtering

---

## When to Combine Both

Debounce inputs, throttle results:

```tsx
const query = useDebounce(input, 300);
const result = useThrottle(query, 1000);
```

Or debounce scroll trigger, throttle scroll event logic.

---

## Libraries

- `lodash.debounce`, `lodash.throttle`
- `use-debounce`, `usehooks-ts`
- `raf-schd` — throttle with `requestAnimationFrame`
- React Query: built-in throttling for background refetches

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Debouncing scroll (delays visible effect)
- Throttling input (feels laggy to user)
- Forgetting to cleanup `setTimeout`
- Debouncing critical event (auth, errors, syncs)

---

## Conclusion: Fast Apps Are Controlled Apps

You don't need to respond **every time** a user does something.

You just need to respond **at the right time**.

Debounce the noise. Throttle the flood.

And give your app room to breathe — one millisecond at a time.
