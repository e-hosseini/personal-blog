# Caching & Memoizing — Speed Without Repetition

Every millisecond counts. And nothing wastes more milliseconds than **doing the same thing twice**.

That’s what caching and memoizing are designed to stop.

**Caching** stores the result of expensive work — network requests, calculations, component trees — so you can **reuse it** instead of recomputing.  
**Memoization** is a type of caching scoped to **pure functions and render lifecycles**, preventing unnecessary recomputations or re-renders.

In this guide, we’ll cover:
- The difference between caching and memoizing
- Practical patterns in JS and React
- In-memory vs persistent cache
- Server vs client caching
- Real-world usage from React Query, Apollo, and SWR

## Why Cache?

Caching improves:
- Load times
- Render speed
- Bandwidth efficiency
- User experience

It reduces:
- Duplicate fetches
- Redundant renders
- Recalculation of pure functions

---

## Memoizing in JavaScript

```ts
function expensiveOperation(x) {
  console.log("Running...");
  return x * x;
}

const memoized = (() => {
  const cache = {};
  return (x) => {
    if (x in cache) return cache[x];
    return (cache[x] = expensiveOperation(x));
  };
})();
```

Call `memoized(5)` multiple times — only the first run actually computes.

---

## Memoization in React

### useMemo()

```tsx
const computedValue = useMemo(() => heavyCalculation(input), [input]);
```

Caches between renders. Recomputes only if `input` changes.

---

### useCallback()

```tsx
const handleClick = useCallback(() => doSomething(id), [id]);
```

Useful to **prevent child re-renders** when passing functions as props.

---

## React.memo()

```tsx
const ListItem = React.memo(({ item }) => {
  return <div>{item.label}</div>;
});
```

Skips re-renders if props haven't changed.

Combine with `useMemo` and `useCallback` for deep optimization.

---

## Caching Network Data

### SWR

```tsx
const { data } = useSWR("/api/user", fetcher);
```

- Caches results in memory
- Supports TTL, stale-while-revalidate
- Resumes from cache on remount or navigation

### React Query

```tsx
useQuery(["posts"], fetchPosts, {
  staleTime: 60 * 1000
});
```

- In-memory caching
- Cache-first strategies
- Pagination-aware

---

## Persistent Caches

- Store with IndexedDB, localStorage, or sessionStorage
- Use for offline mode, resume state, last-used config
- Combine with TTL to avoid stale data

```ts
localStorage.setItem("settings", JSON.stringify(data));
```

But don’t overuse — keep it small, scoped, and avoid stale state.

---

## Real-World Patterns

### GitHub

- Caches issue lists and PR data across tabs
- Avoids re-fetching on same session

### VSCode Web

- Memoizes settings, file structure, recent activity
- IndexedDB for persistence across reloads

### Notion

- Caches block trees for workspace views
- Memoizes block rendering to prevent slow document trees

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Memoizing non-pure functions (side effects = wrong results)
- Over-memoizing (useMemo everywhere — wasteful)
- Caching dynamic data without invalidation
- Using `useMemo` to fix prop drilling that could be lifted

---

## Conclusion: If It’s Expensive, Cache It

Fast apps aren’t just fast at first — they **stay fast** by remembering what they’ve already done.

Memoizing avoids waste.

Caching avoids wait.

And smart engineering avoids **doing more than necessary**.

So think once. Remember often. Render fast.
