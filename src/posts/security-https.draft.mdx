# HTTPS — The Foundation of Modern Web Security

When we talk about modern web security, we start with a protocol that quietly underpins everything: **HTTPS**.

If you're still serving your website over HTTP, you're not just outdated — you're vulnerable. You're also potentially breaking user trust and blocking your access to powerful browser features.

## What is HTTPS?

HTTPS stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**. It’s HTTP — but wrapped in encryption using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.

When a browser connects to your site over HTTPS:
- A TLS handshake occurs
- A symmetric encryption session is established
- All communication between client and server is encrypted and tamper-proof

This ensures **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **authenticity** of data in transit.

## Why HTTPS Matters

### 1. Data Protection

Every request and response is encrypted. Even if intercepted, it’s unreadable. This protects:
- Login credentials
- Session tokens
- Personal user data
- API traffic

### 2. Trust & UX

Modern browsers:
- Show a **lock icon** for HTTPS
- Warn users about **insecure HTTP**
- Block sensitive features (e.g., geolocation, camera access) on HTTP

### 3. SEO & Performance

- Google gives ranking boosts to HTTPS sites
- Required for **HTTP/2**, **Brotli**, and **Core Web Vitals**

---

## How HTTPS Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Client Hello**: The browser sends a list of supported TLS versions and ciphers.
2. **Server Hello**: The server responds with a TLS certificate and chosen cipher.
3. **Certificate Validation**: The browser verifies the certificate (via a trusted CA).
4. **Key Exchange**: They negotiate a symmetric session key (via Diffie-Hellman or RSA).
5. **Secure Session**: All communication is now encrypted with the session key.

## TLS Certificates

### Types of Certificates:
- **DV (Domain Validated)** — basic, fast, used by Let's Encrypt
- **OV (Org Validated)** — includes company info
- **EV (Extended Validation)** — extra vetting, rarely used today

### Free TLS Certificates

- [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- Fully automated via Certbot, ACME protocol
- Trusted by all major browsers

---

## Enforcing HTTPS

- Redirect all HTTP to HTTPS using 301
- Use **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**

```http
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

This tells browsers to always use HTTPS — even on first visit.

---

## HTTPS and Subresources

Ensure that all your resources (CSS, JS, fonts, APIs) are also served over HTTPS. Mixed content causes:
- Browser warnings
- Blocked requests
- Insecure app state

Use Content Security Policy to enforce:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src https:;
```

---

## Tools to Audit HTTPS

- Chrome DevTools → Security tab
- [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
- Mozilla Observatory
- Lighthouse → Security audit

---

## Real-World Usage

### GitHub

- Enforces HTTPS on all domains
- Uses HSTS preload
- All cookies marked `Secure`

### Google

- HTTP/3 + TLS 1.3 across services
- Certificate rotation and automation at massive scale

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Self-signed certs in production
- HTTP fallback or redirects back to HTTP
- Expired or unrefreshed certs
- Not using Secure or SameSite on cookies

---

## Conclusion: Don’t Ship Without It

There is no excuse — not one — for launching a modern site without HTTPS.

It’s not just about security anymore. It’s about:
- Performance
- Trust
- SEO
- Feature access

So install that cert. Redirect that traffic. Set that HSTS header.

Because plain HTTP is dead — and HTTPS is your baseline.
