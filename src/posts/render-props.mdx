# Render Props — Composable Logic Through JSX Functions

The **render props** pattern changed how we think about composition in React. Before hooks, before context API improvements, render props were the primary way to **reuse logic between components** without inheritance or HOCs.

A render prop is a component prop whose value is a function. Instead of rendering static JSX, a component calls this function, passing in values — such as state, events, or computed data — and lets the **consumer decide what to render**.

This pattern makes component APIs **highly flexible** and **inversion-of-control friendly**. But it also comes with tradeoffs.

In this deep technical breakdown, we’ll look at:
- What render props are and how they work
- Why they exist and what problems they solve
- Alternatives (hooks, HOCs, slots)
- Real-world use cases
- Gotchas around performance and readability

---

## What Is a Render Prop?

A **render prop** is a function provided as a child or prop to a component that returns JSX.

```tsx
<MyComponent>
  {(data) => <div>{data.value}</div>}
</MyComponent>
```

Or as a named prop:

```tsx
<MyComponent render={({ value }) => <span>{value}</span>} />
```

The component owning the state or behavior simply **calls this function**, passing in the relevant arguments.

---

## Why It Exists: The Composition Problem

Early React patterns struggled with code reuse:
- Inheritance didn’t scale
- Mixins were error-prone
- HOCs caused prop conflicts and were hard to type

Render props gave developers a way to **delegate rendering** to consumers while encapsulating behavior.

It solved:
- Reusability: Share logic across components
- Flexibility: Let consumers choose UI
- Composition: Combine components functionally

---

## Anatomy of a Render Prop Component

Here’s a simplified version of a `MouseTracker` component:

```tsx
function MouseTracker({ children }) {
  const [coords, setCoords] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const move = (e) => setCoords({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", move);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", move);
  }, []);

  return children(coords);
}
```

Usage:

```tsx
<MouseTracker>
  {({ x, y }) => <div>Mouse at ({x}, {y})</div>}
</MouseTracker>
```

The behavior (tracking) is encapsulated. The **presentation** is delegated.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Tooltips and Popovers

```tsx
<Popover>
  {({ isOpen, toggle }) => (
    <>
      <button onClick={toggle}>Toggle</button>
      {isOpen && <div className="popover">Info</div>}
    </>
  )}
</Popover>
```

### Form Field Abstraction

```tsx
<Field name="email">
  {({ field, meta }) => (
    <input {...field} className={meta.touched && meta.error ? "error" : ""} />
  )}
</Field>
```

Used in libraries like Formik and React Final Form.

### Authenticated User Context

```tsx
<AuthProvider>
  {({ user }) => (
    <span>Hello, {user.name}</span>
  )}
</AuthProvider>
```

## Render Props vs Hooks

Hooks are now the dominant pattern for logic reuse — but render props are still useful when:
- You want to **control rendering scope** (e.g., animate children)
- You need a **composable API** for layout
- You’re working with class components or non-hook-aware libraries

Hooks solve the logic reuse problem better — but they can’t replace render props when **you want to delegate rendering itself**.

---

## Performance Considerations

Render props create **new functions on every render**, which can break `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.memo`.

Mitigation strategies:
- Use `React.memo` + stable props
- Lift render function outside parent render
- Avoid deeply nested render prop trees (aka “callback hell”)

---

## Patterns That Evolved From Render Props

- **Headless components**: Expose state and behavior via render props or hooks (e.g., Headless UI, Reakit)
- **Compound components**: Use context to share state, children define structure
- **Slots (in Web Components/Vue)**: Named content injection, similar to render props but declarative

---

## Famous Examples

- `React Motion` used render props to animate values
- `Downshift` (autocomplete) used render props to expose full control of dropdown behavior
- `React Router` supported both static and render-prop-based routes

```tsx
<Route path="/profile" render={() => <Profile />} />
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Overusing render props for simple values (better passed as props)
- Nesting render props more than 2-3 levels
- Inline anonymous functions that hurt performance
- Mixing multiple render prop styles in the same tree

---

## Conclusion: Controlled Flexibility at Its Best

Render props are a pattern — not a technology. They’re about **inversion of control**, letting consumers define *how*, while providers define *what*.

They paved the way for hooks, headless libraries, and rich composability.

They’re not always the best tool — but when you need rendering **as an argument**, render props are your friend.

Give logic. Let users choose structure.

That’s what great APIs do.
