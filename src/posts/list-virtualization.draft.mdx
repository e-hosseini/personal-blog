# List Virtualization — Rendering Millions of Rows Without Breaking the Browser

Your UI renders a list of 10,000 items. The user scrolls. The page lags. Frames drop. CPU spikes.

Sound familiar?

Rendering large lists is one of the most common — and most painful — frontend performance problems. But there's a solution: **list virtualization**.

List virtualization (or virtual scrolling) is a technique where only the **visible items** in a list are rendered. Everything outside the viewport is **ignored until needed**. This dramatically reduces DOM nodes, memory usage, and render time.

In this article, we’ll cover:
- What virtualization is and why it works
- How to implement it in React with `react-window` and `react-virtual`
- Dynamic heights, sticky headers, and infinite scroll
- Real-world examples from Slack, Discord, and Facebook
- Anti-patterns and debugging tips

## The Problem: The DOM Is Expensive

Each item you render:
- Creates a DOM node
- May trigger style/layout/repaint
- Consumes memory

Rendering 100+ elements = fine. 1,000+ = maybe. 10,000+? Your browser chokes.

Even worse with:
- Images
- Rich text
- Heavy nested markup

The solution? Render only what the user can **see**.

## What Is Virtualization?

Instead of rendering the entire list, you render a **window** of it — typically just the visible items + a buffer.

```tsx
<List height={600} itemCount={10000} itemSize={35} width={800}>
  {({ index, style }) => (
    <div style={style}>Item {index}</div>
  )}
</List>
```

Under the hood:
- The wrapper container is scrollable
- Visible rows are positioned with absolute or transform CSS
- Only a small subset exists in the DOM

Popular libraries:
- `react-window` (Brian Vaughn)
- `react-virtual` (Tanner Linsley)
- `react-virtualized` (legacy, but still used)

---

## Benefits

- Render performance improves by 10–100x
- Less GC churn, faster FPS
- Scroll smoothness on mobile and low-end devices
- Great for chat logs, tables, infinite feeds

---

## Real-World Examples

### Slack

- Virtualizes message history
- Avoids re-rendering old messages unless scrolled into view

### Discord

- Uses virtualization for chat, member list, and emojis
- Manages animation + virtualization seamlessly

### Facebook

- Feed virtualization keeps timeline fast even with media-rich posts
- Reuses DOM nodes where possible

## Dynamic Height Rows

Trickier — because you don’t know size in advance.

Options:
- Use `VariableSizeList` from `react-window`
- Estimate + measure with ResizeObserver
- Memoize measured heights and recalculate layout

```tsx
<VariableSizeList itemSize={getItemSize} />
```

---

## Infinite Scroll + Virtualization

Virtualization ≠ infinite scroll. But they pair well:

```tsx
const isItemLoaded = index => !!data[index];
const loadMoreItems = (startIndex, stopIndex) => {
  return fetchData(startIndex, stopIndex);
};

<InfiniteLoader
  isItemLoaded={isItemLoaded}
  loadMoreItems={loadMoreItems}
  itemCount={10000}
>
  {({ onItemsRendered, ref }) => (
    <FixedSizeList
      ref={ref}
      onItemsRendered={onItemsRendered}
      height={600}
      itemCount={10000}
      itemSize={35}
      width={800}
    >
      {Row}
    </FixedSizeList>
  )}
</InfiniteLoader>
```

## Sticky Headers & Grouping

Sticky rows require additional tracking:

- Use portals to extract DOM nodes
- Render sticky headers separately and sync scroll
- Maintain mapping of row positions for scroll offset

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Rendering all rows in `map()` for big lists
- Using `display: none` or `visibility: hidden` instead of removing
- Animating non-visible rows
- Forcing layout with dynamic `height: auto` in virtual rows

---

## Conclusion: Scale Your UI Without Sacrificing UX

List virtualization makes the impossible possible — rendering huge data sets **without hurting the user**.

If you’ve got 1,000+ rows, it’s not just a nice-to-have. It’s **necessary**.

So stop rendering what the user can’t see.

And let your interface breathe.

Because less DOM = more performance.
