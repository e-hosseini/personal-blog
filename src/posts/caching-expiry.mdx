# Caching + Expiry — Serving Fast, Staying Fresh

Caching is one of the most effective ways to improve perceived performance — but it’s also a minefield. Get it wrong, and your users see stale or incorrect data. Get it right, and your app feels instant, consistent, and efficient.

In frontend apps, **caching and expiry** strategies determine how data is reused, how often it’s fetched, and how fast the experience feels. The key is to serve data **fast**, while ensuring it’s **fresh enough** to be trusted.

In this article, we explore:
- Cache layers and types
- Expiry mechanisms (TTL, stale-while-revalidate)
- Cache control via HTTP headers and libraries
- Client-side vs server-side considerations
- Real-world techniques used in GitHub, Stripe, and Vercel

---

## Why Cache?

- Reduce API calls and network traffic
- Improve response time and perceived UX
- Avoid flicker during refetch
- Support offline access
- Save battery and bandwidth

But caching without expiry is dangerous — you may show old or incorrect data forever.

---

## Caching Layers in Frontend

1. **Memory cache** — in-memory object/state (fast, volatile)
2. **Persistent cache** — IndexedDB, localStorage (long-lived)
3. **HTTP cache** — browser-native (`Cache-Control`)
4. **Library cache** — SWR, React Query, Apollo Client
5. **Edge cache** — CDN, server prefetch

Each layer has its own expiration model, storage, and invalidation logic.

---

## Expiry Strategies

### Time-To-Live (TTL)

Data expires after a fixed interval.

```js
const cached = getFromCache();
if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < 1000 * 60 * 5) {
  return cached.value;
}
```

### Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR)

Use stale data instantly, fetch fresh data in the background:

```tsx
const { data } = useSWR("/api/user", fetcher, {
  refreshInterval: 30000,
});
```

Useful when data isn’t **critical** to be 100% up-to-date (e.g. dashboards, lists).

---

## HTTP Headers for Caching

```http
Cache-Control: public, max-age=60, stale-while-revalidate=30
ETag: "abc123"
```

- `max-age`: How long data is fresh
- `stale-while-revalidate`: Use stale content during fetch
- `ETag`: Unique ID for the content

Browser will cache and revalidate on next request if expired.

---

## Manual Expiry in React Query

```tsx
useQuery("user", fetchUser, {
  staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
  cacheTime: 1000 * 60 * 10, // garbage collection after idle
});
```

- `staleTime`: How long data is "fresh"
- `cacheTime`: How long data stays in memory before being deleted

---

## Cache Invalidation

Cache invalidation is the hardest part.

Strategies:
- Revalidate on focus/tab restore
- Invalidate after mutations (`queryClient.invalidateQueries`)
- Use cache keys + query params for per-resource freshness
- Periodic TTL expiry (auto refetch)

---

## Real-World Practices

### GitHub

- Uses ETag-based revalidation
- Stale cache for performance; always revalidates on focus

### Stripe

- Caches static resources (prices, metadata)
- Authenticated data bypasses CDN; session-local cache only

### Vercel

- Leverages CDN + client-side SWR
- Prefetches on hover + keeps cache warm across nav

---

## Anti-Patterns

- No cache (needlessly slow every time)
- Infinite cache without expiry (stale forever)
- Relying on `localStorage` without TTL logic
- Refetching data on every page load
- Mutating cached data without invalidating

---

## Conclusion: Fast Feels Fresh — But Only If You Control It

Caching is performance magic. But expiry is the safety switch.

Build a cache that’s:
- Fast by default
- Smart about staleness
- Respectful of user trust

Because no one wants to stare at a spinner.

And no one wants to see data from last Tuesday.

Cache fast.

Expire wisely.
