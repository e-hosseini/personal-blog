# Optimistic Updates — Perceived Performance at Its Best

Users don’t care when the server finishes.

They care when they **see something happen**.

That’s why **optimistic updates** are a game-changer for frontend performance. They shift the focus from response time to **perceived responsiveness** — and that’s what defines user experience.

In this guide, we’ll unpack:
- What optimistic updates are
- Why they’re a performance technique, not just UX
- How to implement them in React, SWR, and React Query
- Error handling, rollback, and real-world use cases
- Anti-patterns to avoid when making your UI feel magical

---

## What Are Optimistic Updates?

An optimistic update is when you:
1. Assume a mutation will succeed
2. Update the UI as if it already has
3. Send the network request in parallel
4. Rollback or patch if the server disagrees

Classic example: the Like button.

You click. The heart fills immediately. Server call runs in the background.

---

## Why This Improves Performance

While optimistic updates don’t reduce **real latency**, they:
- Remove **perceived latency**
- Avoid spinner-driven experiences
- Keep UI responsive even under poor conditions

You **eliminate wait time** from the user's perspective.

---

## React Implementation (Manual)

```tsx
const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);

const handleLike = () => {
  setLiked(true); // Optimistic UI

  fetch("/api/like", { method: "POST" })
    .then(res => {
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error();
    })
    .catch(() => {
      setLiked(false); // Rollback
    });
};
```

This works — but requires manual rollback logic and error handling.

---

## React Query Implementation

```tsx
const mutation = useMutation(likePost, {
  onMutate: async (newData) => {
    await queryClient.cancelQueries("likes");
    const prevLikes = queryClient.getQueryData("likes");

    queryClient.setQueryData("likes", (old) => [...old, newData]);
    return { prevLikes };
  },
  onError: (err, newData, context) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData("likes", context.prevLikes);
  },
  onSettled: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries("likes");
  },
});
```

React Query handles rollback, deduping, and background validation.

---

## SWR with Optimistic UI

```tsx
mutate("/api/cart", async (cart) => {
  const updated = [...cart, newItem];
  await fetch("/api/cart", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(newItem) });
  return updated;
}, { optimisticData: [...data, newItem], rollbackOnError: true });
```

SWR makes it declarative — one line for rollback, one for UI guess.

---

## Real-World Apps That Use This

### Twitter

- Likes, retweets, bookmarks update instantly
- Server syncs or corrects in the background

### Notion

- Offline-first edits stored and synced
- User sees changes instantly — even before network sends them

### Figma

- Multi-user edits are optimistically applied and synced over WebSocket

---

## When to Use It

✅ Good use cases:
- Likes, stars, reactions
- Form saves that are unlikely to fail
- Add-to-cart interactions
- Inline edits (e.g., settings toggles)

❌ Avoid for:
- Payments, purchases
- Highly volatile server state
- Multi-step workflows where rollback is hard

---

## Performance Metrics Improved

- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: UX feels responsive
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Interactions not blocked by fetch
- **User-perceived latency**: Virtually eliminated

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Not handling failures (no rollback = inconsistent UI)
- Optimistic update with destructive actions (e.g., deletion)
- Updating multiple pieces of state with no undo
- Assuming success when server may reject (e.g., auth, limits)

---

## Conclusion: Predict the Future (Responsibly)

Optimistic updates don’t just speed up your app.

They **reshape time** — collapsing seconds into milliseconds.

It’s a bet that most operations will succeed. When they do, your users experience **instant feedback**.

And when they don’t? You’re ready to clean up the mess.

Fast isn’t just about code execution.

It’s about delivering the feeling of speed.

Optimistic updates do exactly that.
