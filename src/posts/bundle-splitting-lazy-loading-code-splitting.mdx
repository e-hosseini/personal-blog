# Bundle Splitting, Lazy Loading & Code Splitting — Accelerating Initial Load Speed

As a rule of thumb in web development, the larger your JavaScript bundle, the longer the user has to wait. The severity of this issue cannot be understated.

Consider this scenario: when a user accesses your application, they aren't interested in downloading every feature you've ever developed. They are primarily concerned with viewing your homepage. This is where the techniques of **bundle splitting**, **lazy loading**, and **code splitting** become crucial.

These methodologies are the bedrock of modern frontend performance engineering. By segmenting your code into smaller units, you can:

- Load only what’s necessary for the current view
- Decrease the size of the initial bundle
- Hasten the time to interactivity
- Enhance Core Web Vitals such as LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) and FID (First Input Delay)
- Implement more effective caching strategies

## Back to the Beginnings

In the genesis of Single Page Applications (SPAs), bundlers like Webpack amalgamated every script into a single, monolithic `.js` file. While this was convenient, it was detrimental to performance — particularly on mobile networks.

As applications ballooned in size, so did the bundles. We began to see sizes of 1MB, 2MB, and beyond. Users were forced to endure a wait of several seconds just to view a single button.

In response, popular frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue began offering **route-based lazy loading**. With the advent of Webpack 2, the `import()` function was introduced for dynamic loading. Nowadays, tools like Vite and Rollup make code splitting almost frictionless.

Contemporary browsers, CDNs (Content Delivery Networks), and build tools are designed for **modular, lazy-loadable architectures**. As developers, it is our responsibility to make full use of these optimizations.

## Central Concepts

### Bundle Splitting

The idea of bundle splitting involves segmenting your application into multiple output files (known as chunks) rather than a single bundle. You can categorize these chunks as follows:

- Main bundle: This is the principal chunk of your application.
- Vendor bundle: This contains libraries such as React and lodash.
- Route-specific bundles: These are unique to specific routes (e.g., Dashboard.js, Settings.js).

Smaller bundles load more quickly and allow for **independent caching**.

### Code Splitting

Code splitting is the process of dividing your code **on-demand** using dynamic imports. For example:

```tsx
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./Dashboard"));
```

Webpack automatically generates a new chunk for each `import()` statement.

### Lazy Loading

Lazy loading refers to the loading of a component **only when it’s required**. For instance:

```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
  <Dashboard />
</Suspense>
```

This technique delays the loading of non-critical code, thereby improving the initial load time.

## Tools and Configuration

### Webpack

In Webpack, you can enable code splitting with the `import()` function as follows:

```js
output: {
  filename: "[name].bundle.js",
  chunkFilename: "[name].chunk.js"
}
```

You can also use the `SplitChunksPlugin` to segment vendor code:

```js
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: "all"
  }
}
```

### Vite

Vite employs Rollup under the hood and automatically splits chunks based on dynamic imports.

To customize this, you can use:

```ts
rollupOptions: {
  output: {
    manualChunks: {
      vendor: ["react", "react-dom"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Real-World Applications

### Facebook

Facebook segments the newsfeed, chat, notifications, and profile views into **separate modules**.

They also lazy load components such as comments, reactions, and image viewers to minimize the initial JavaScript load.

### Airbnb

Airbnb utilizes route-based splitting and prefetches assets for the upcoming page as users hover over links.

### Google Docs

Google Docs separates every major editor plugin into lazy modules. You don’t load the logic for spreadsheets until you actually open a spreadsheet.

## Potential Pitfalls and Gotchas

- Over-splitting can lead to increased HTTP overhead due to a large number of small files.
- Lazy loading too much may delay essential UI components.
- Untracked dynamic imports can cause the vendor chunk to bloat.
- The fallback UI for Suspense must be graceful to avoid flickering.

---

## Progressive Enhancement

You can use `rel="preload"` or `rel="prefetch"` to **hint to the browser**:

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/static/js/Dashboard.chunk.js" as="script" />
```

This can reduce the delay experienced when the user navigates through your application.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**

Code splitting assists all of these metrics by decreasing JavaScript evaluation and execution time.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Bundling the logic for an admin dashboard with the landing page.
- Importing all routes/components eagerly.
- Not chunking third-party vendors.
- Lazy loading content that is above-the-fold (this can harm LCP).

## Conclusion: Load Less, Show More

Bundle splitting and lazy loading are not just performance hacks — they are **foundational architectural patterns** for modern web applications.

These techniques reward forward-thinking and modular thought processes.

Most importantly, they provide users with the one thing they truly desire:

Speed.
