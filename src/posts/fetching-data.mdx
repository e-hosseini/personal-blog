# Fetching Data — The Foundation of Web App Networking

Fetching data is the **lifeblood of modern web applications**. It’s how your frontend stays connected to your backend — and the world.

Whether you're building a dashboard, form, feed, or chat system, nearly everything in a web app involves some kind of **remote data retrieval**. That’s why mastering fetch patterns is foundational for frontend engineers.

In this guide, we’ll explore:
- Core concepts in data fetching
- `fetch` vs Axios vs modern libraries
- Caching, retries, and cancellation
- React-specific strategies and lifecycle alignment
- Security, performance, and real-world pitfalls

---

## Why Data Fetching Matters

Most frontend code isn’t static. It reacts to **users**, **APIs**, and **backend events**. The quality of your data-fetching strategy affects:
- Load times
- Responsiveness
- Perceived performance
- Error resilience
- Server efficiency

Bad data fetching = poor UX, flaky state, wasted bandwidth, and unhappy users.

## The Core Patterns

### 1. Direct Fetch

```ts
const res = await fetch("/api/data");
const json = await res.json();
```

Simple, but lacks built-in retries, error handling, timeouts, or cancellation.

### 2. Axios

```ts
const { data } = await axios.get("/api/data");
```

Axios offers:
- Automatic JSON parsing
- Better error object semantics
- Timeouts, interceptors, and cancel tokens
- Popular in enterprise apps

### 3. React useEffect Pattern

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function load() {
    const res = await fetch("/api/items");
    const json = await res.json();
    setData(json);
  }
  load();
}, []);
```

Handles lifecycle, but lacks cache/retry/dedupe unless paired with state management.

---

## React-Specific Solutions

### React Query / TanStack Query

```tsx
const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery("products", () =>
  fetch("/api/products").then(res => res.json())
);
```

Benefits:
- Automatic caching and deduplication
- Refetch on focus/reconnect
- Pagination and background updates
- Devtools and retry logic

### SWR (from Vercel)

```tsx
const { data, error } = useSWR("/api/data", fetcher);
```

- Stale-while-revalidate
- Revalidation on focus
- Lightweight, declarative

---

## Key Fetch Concepts

### Caching

Avoid repeated requests for the same data. Use libraries with built-in cache or store responses manually.

### Deduplication

Prevent multiple fetches for the same key running at once — especially in concurrent React or list rendering.

### Cancellation

Use `AbortController` or `cancelToken` to abort in-flight requests if component unmounts or params change.

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });
controller.abort();
```

---

## Pagination and Infinite Load

Use:
- `offset`/`limit` or cursor-based URLs
- Load more buttons or scroll listeners
- React Query `useInfiniteQuery()` or SWR `useSWRInfinite()`

Don’t refetch all pages on one change — cache slices.

---

## Error Handling

Surface loading errors clearly:

```tsx
if (error) return <div>Error loading data: {error.message}</div>;
```

Also:
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Log to Sentry or DataDog
- Fallback UI when offline

---

## Fetching on Events

Not all fetches happen on mount. Trigger manually on:
- Button clicks
- Form submissions
- Tab changes
- Intersection observer scroll events

Use `useCallback` + async function patterns.

---

## Security Concerns

- Always validate and sanitize on the server
- Don’t trust frontend data blindly
- Avoid exposing sensitive tokens in request params
- Use `https`, set CORS policies correctly
- Obfuscate fetch logic if needed via proxies

---

## Real-World Patterns

### Stripe Dashboard

- Uses React Query for customer/product data
- Polls selectively on specific components
- Cancels when tabs switch or filters change

### GitHub

- Uses batched GraphQL fetches with normalized caching
- Prefetches on hover for PR diffs, comments
- Differs polling rate by page context

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Fetching inside render body
- Not handling errors or empty state
- Triggering redundant fetches on every rerender
- Forgetting to debounce param-driven fetches (e.g., search)
- Ignoring slow networks / bad responses

---

## Conclusion: Fetch with Purpose

Data fetching is easy to get started with — but hard to master.

You’re not just requesting data. You’re managing:
- Network performance
- User feedback
- State synchronization
- Server load
- Component lifecycle

Fetch with intent. Abstract smartly. And always design like your bandwidth matters.

Because it does.
