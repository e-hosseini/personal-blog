# Event Handlers ‚Äî Bridging UI and Logic in Component Design

In component-driven design, **event handlers** are the glue between static markup and dynamic behavior. They're how we make UIs **interactive, responsive, and intelligent** ‚Äî responding to clicks, scrolls, keystrokes, pointer moves, and more.

While it‚Äôs easy to attach a `onClick={...}` handler, architecting event systems in a way that scales across reusable components is a deeper skill. Great component APIs expose events in ways that are predictable, composable, and semantically rich ‚Äî so parent components can respond with logic that feels natural.

In this article, we‚Äôll dive into:
- Native vs synthetic events
- Handler patterns in React
- Composition vs delegation
- Custom event signatures
- Accessibility concerns
- Real-world practices in design systems

## Why Event Handling Is Core to Component APIs

Imagine a `<Button>` that can‚Äôt `onClick`. Or a `<Modal>` that doesn‚Äôt expose an `onClose`. Without event handlers, components are **passive** ‚Äî unable to communicate intent or react to user behavior.

Handlers are:
- The primary way components express user intent
- How logic moves from presentation to behavior
- A contract between a component and its parent

But as your system grows, simple handlers become more complex:
- Should we call one handler or many?
- What if both parent and child want to handle the same event?
- Should we debounce? Prevent default? Capture phase?

Answers depend on **how well you design your handler API**.

## React Event Handling Primer

In React, all DOM events are normalized into **Synthetic Events** ‚Äî wrappers over native browser events for cross-browser consistency.

```tsx
<button onClick={(e) => {
  console.log(e.currentTarget); // Button
}}>Click Me</button>
```

Synthetic events:
- Support all standard DOM event types (`onClick`, `onChange`, `onKeyDown`, etc.)
- Have pooled memory management (now mostly deprecated in React 17+)
- Can be passed to custom components as props

---

## Passing Event Handlers to Components

In component APIs, event handlers are typically **prop callbacks**:

```tsx
function Modal({ onClose }: { onClose: () => void }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClose}>
      Close
    </button>
  );
}
```

This makes the behavior **declarative and portable**. The parent defines what should happen when the event occurs ‚Äî not the component itself.

---

## Composing Events in Reusable Components

Often, a component needs to handle its **own event logic** *and* call the user's handler.

```tsx
function Button({ onClick }: { onClick?: () => void }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={(e) => {
      // Internal behavior
      trackClick("button");

      // External behavior
      onClick?.(e);
    }}>
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```

This pattern is critical for:
- Analytics
- Accessibility (e.g., toggling aria attributes)
- Preventing conflicts or leaks

üí° Always check if the user handler is defined before calling.

---

## Custom Event Signatures

You can also define **custom event shapes**:

```tsx
type OnValueChange = (value: string, meta: { event: Event }) => void;

function Input({ onChange }: { onChange: OnValueChange }) {
  return (
    <input onChange={(e) =>
      onChange(e.target.value, { event: e })
    } />
  );
}
```

This helps abstract away internal DOM quirks, normalize behavior, or provide richer metadata to the parent.

---

## Event Prop Naming Conventions

Well-designed component libraries use **consistent naming**:

| Purpose        | Prop Name      |
|----------------|----------------|
| Clicks         | `onClick`      |
| Toggling state | `onToggle`     |
| Input value    | `onChange`     |
| Focus events   | `onFocus`, `onBlur` |
| Submissions    | `onSubmit`     |
| Dismissals     | `onClose`, `onCancel` |

Custom events should follow semantic names, not just low-level DOM mappings.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Radix UI

Every interactive component exposes multiple handlers:

```tsx
<Dialog onOpenChange={fn} onCloseAutoFocus={fn} />
```

This enables fine-tuned control over behavior, transitions, and lifecycle without modifying internal logic.

### Headless UI (Tailwind)

Events are exposed and forwarded through custom components ‚Äî giving full control to the parent without compromising reusability.

### Material UI

Uses synthetic events in all components, forwards handlers, and documents all expected event shapes. Integrates seamlessly with form libraries via custom change propagation.

---

## Accessibility and Events

Keyboard events are as important as pointer events:

```tsx
onKeyDown={(e) => {
  if (e.key === "Enter" || e.key === " ") {
    onClick?.();
  }
}}
```

- Use `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` if you're building a custom clickable component
- Consider screen reader context for `onFocus`, `onBlur`, and `aria-*` attributes
- Never rely on `onMouseDown` only ‚Äî always provide `onKeyDown` for parity

---

## Event Forwarding in Component Composition

You may want to forward handlers down to internal components:

```tsx
function Tooltip({ onMouseEnter, children }) {
  return (
    <div onMouseEnter={onMouseEnter}>
      <TooltipContent />
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful not to override internal logic unless explicitly supported ‚Äî composition should be additive, not destructive.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Mutating state inside external event handlers (breaks predictability)
- Forgetting to call `preventDefault()` when needed (e.g., forms)
- Double-binding events in both parent and child (can create infinite loops)
- Using anonymous arrow functions everywhere (re-renders, hard to debug)
- Ignoring async nature of some handlers (race conditions in updates)

---

## Conclusion: Events Are Your API's Expression Layer

Event handlers are how your components communicate back to their consumers. They define the **behavioral surface area** ‚Äî the hooks for logic, the entry points for UX.

Design them like interfaces:
- Name clearly
- Validate consistently
- Compose respectfully
- Expose meaning, not just mechanics

Because every component is just a container ‚Äî until it starts to react.
