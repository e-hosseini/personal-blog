# Planning in AI Agents — Teaching Models to Think Ahead

The difference between a chatbot and an intelligent assistant isn’t its vocabulary — it’s **how it thinks about the future**.

Imagine this: You tell your AI assistant, _“Find me a flight to Tokyo, book a hotel near Shibuya, and schedule reminders for visa processing.”_

A traditional model might try to answer that in one shot — and fail.

An **agent with planning** does something different:
- Breaks down your goal into discrete steps
- Understands dependencies (flight first, hotel second)
- Chooses appropriate tools (e.g., `searchFlights()`, `bookHotel()`)
- Decides when to act and when to ask
- Monitors progress and adapts if plans fail

Planning is **not just responding**. It’s charting a course toward a result.

## What Is Planning?

In AI, planning is the **deliberate process of deciding how to achieve a goal**.

It involves:
- Understanding the desired outcome
- Decomposing the problem into subgoals
- Deciding the order of operations
- Assigning tools or strategies to each step
- Revising when the path fails

It's how humans approach complex tasks — and it's how we teach AI to do the same.

## Why LLMs Struggle Without Planning

LLMs trained on static text often respond in a single pass. They’re reactive. Without scaffolding, they:
- Jump to conclusions
- Miss dependencies
- Skip verification
- Fail to recover from errors

Planning introduces:
- Deliberation
- Decomposition
- Control flow
- Contextual iteration

## Techniques for Planning in Agents

### 1. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

The agent alternates between _thinking_ and _doing_.

```text
Thought: I need to check today’s weather.
Action: getWeather("Paris")

Observation: Sunny and warm.

Thought: No umbrella needed.
Response: Looks like clear skies today!
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Encourage the model to _think step by step_ before acting.

```text
To send flowers:
1. Check recipient’s location
2. Find nearby florists
3. Select a bouquet
4. Schedule delivery
```

### 3. Tool Planning with Vercel AI SDK

Create tools and let the model choose which to call:

```ts
const tools = [searchFlights, bookHotel, sendReminder];
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Plan a Tokyo trip in July" }]
});
```

## Planning with Vercel AI SDK

Use `createTool()` to build callable functions, then let `generateText()` orchestrate them.

```ts
const summarize = createTool({ ... });
const analyze = createTool({ ... });

await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools: [summarize, analyze],
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Create a Q2 performance review" }]
});
```

You can even return structured plans:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    { "action": "fetchMetrics" },
    { "action": "summarizeFindings" },
    { "action": "emailReport" }
  ]
}
```

## Challenges of Planning

- Requires long-term memory
- Can be brittle if assumptions change
- May need retries and corrections
- Needs logs, observability, and retry control

You can improve robustness via:
- External memory stores
- Planning + execution separation
- Agent traces and feedback loops

## Conclusion: From Language to Logic

Planning transforms language models into **autonomous systems**.

It’s what lets them:
- Understand goals
- Break them down
- Choose tools
- Retry and recover

From Copilot to trip planners, the future of AI isn't just conversational — it’s **cognitive, structured, and goal-aware**.

With planning, we don’t just ask models to respond.

We ask them to **think**.
