# API Error Handling ‚Äî Designing for Clarity, Debugging, and Trust

Your API is going to fail. Period.

What matters is **how it fails** ‚Äî and what it communicates when it does.

A great API doesn‚Äôt just succeed elegantly. It fails **intelligently**. It explains, recovers, and guides developers toward resolution. And it does so **consistently**.

This article is a deep dive into how modern APIs ‚Äî REST, GraphQL, and beyond ‚Äî handle errors at scale. We‚Äôll cover status codes, error payloads, developer experience, observability, retries, and best practices from leading platforms.

## Why Error Handling Matters

Unclear error messages are a productivity killer. They:
- Waste developer time
- Lead to customer frustration
- Break automation scripts and clients
- Increase support tickets and onboarding friction

Your error response is part of your developer interface ‚Äî as important as your success payloads.

## The Anatomy of a Good API Error

Whether REST or GraphQL, good error responses have:
- A clear **error code**
- A human-readable **message**
- A machine-readable **type**
- Optional **details** for debugging
- A consistent schema across all endpoints

### Example (REST)

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "Missing required field: email",
    "field": "email",
    "status": 400
  }
}
```

### Example (GraphQL)

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "User not found",
      "path": ["user"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "NOT_FOUND",
        "status": 404,
        "timestamp": "2024-03-21T18:20:33Z"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## HTTP Status Codes (REST)

Using the right code matters. Some guidelines:

| Status | Meaning                      | Use For                        |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 200    | OK                            | Success                        |
| 201    | Created                       | Resource successfully made     |
| 204    | No Content                    | Delete success                 |
| 400    | Bad Request                   | Client mistake (missing params)|
| 401    | Unauthorized                  | Missing/invalid auth           |
| 403    | Forbidden                     | Authenticated but not allowed  |
| 404    | Not Found                     | Missing resource               |
| 409    | Conflict                      | Versioning/state conflicts     |
| 422    | Unprocessable Entity          | Validation errors              |
| 429    | Too Many Requests             | Rate limiting                  |
| 500    | Internal Server Error         | Generic failure                |
| 503    | Service Unavailable           | Server down / retryable        |

üí° Tip: Stick to this core set. Avoid rarely-used codes that confuse clients.

## GraphQL and Error Handling

GraphQL returns 200 OK **even on errors**. Errors are placed inside the `errors` field, not reflected by HTTP status.

This creates a dual world:
- Network layer: always 200
- App layer: success or failure inside response body

Best practice is to include an `extensions.code` for all error types:

```json
{
  "extensions": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "details": {...}
  }
}
```

Frameworks like Apollo, urql, and Relay help manage these errors with hooks and typed responses.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Stripe

Stripe includes:
- Status code
- Error type (`card_error`, `api_error`, `validation_error`)
- Error code (`invalid_number`)
- Field (`card[number]`)
- Helpful message (`Your card number is invalid`)

Their responses are **predictable, localized, and documented**.

### GitHub

GraphQL errors include:
- Error path
- Code
- Message
- Hints for invalid queries, schema errors, and auth failures

### Shopify

Includes `errors` key in responses with:
- `message`
- `code`
- `field`
- Optional debug headers

---

## Observability and Logging

All API errors should be:
- Logged with full context (user ID, headers, request ID)
- Correlated with tracing spans
- Reported via alerting if error rate spikes
- Easily queryable by engineers and support teams

Use structured logs (JSON) and group errors by `type`, not just message strings.

---

## Retryability and Safety

Errors must signal whether they‚Äôre **retryable**:
- ‚úÖ 503, 429 ‚Üí retry with backoff
- ‚ùå 400, 401, 403 ‚Üí don‚Äôt retry

Include `Retry-After` headers when appropriate. And mark non-idempotent requests clearly to avoid double effects (e.g., duplicate orders).

---

## Developer UX Best Practices

- Document every error code and example in your API docs
- Use consistent field names: `code`, `message`, `field`, `details`
- Avoid 500 for expected errors (e.g., user already exists)
- Make messages user-friendly but detailed enough for devs
- Localize errors when needed for end-user presentation

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using 200 for all responses (except GraphQL)
- Generic `message: "Something went wrong"` errors
- Failing silently with 204 when an error occurred
- Mixing validation errors with generic API errors
- Logging only message, not context

---

## Conclusion: Good Errors Are a Feature

Error handling isn‚Äôt just a fail-safe ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **feature**.

Done right, it makes developers more productive, systems more observable, and users more confident. It‚Äôs not enough to catch and return. You have to **design** the failure modes as intentionally as the success paths.

Errors happen. Let them teach you ‚Äî and help your users recover.

Design errors like you design APIs: with clarity, consistency, and care.
