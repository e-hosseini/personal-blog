# Timeouts — Knowing When to Give Up on the Network

One of the hardest lessons in frontend engineering: **not all network requests will complete**. Some get stuck. Some are delayed. Some are just lost in the void.

That’s why timeouts matter.

A **timeout** sets a deadline for a request to complete. If it doesn’t finish in time, it’s cancelled or treated as failed. This simple pattern protects your app from hanging indefinitely — and gives your users timely feedback when something goes wrong.

In this article, we’ll cover:
- Why timeouts are essential
- How to implement them in fetch, Axios, and beyond
- When to set deadlines (and how long they should be)
- How timeouts improve resilience, UX, and observability
- Real-world timeout behavior from apps like Gmail, Slack, and more

## What Is a Timeout?

A timeout is a **maximum wait time** for a network operation to succeed. If the operation takes longer, it’s aborted.

Reasons a request might hang:
- Server is overloaded or unresponsive
- Network conditions are degraded
- DNS or TLS negotiation fails
- Middleware (e.g., proxies, firewalls) interfere

Without a timeout, the request may **never resolve** — leading to stuck UIs, memory leaks, and poor UX.

---

## How to Implement Timeouts (Fetch)

Native `fetch()` does not include a built-in timeout — but you can use `AbortController`:

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeout = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

fetch("/api/data", { signal: controller.signal })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .catch(err => {
    if (err.name === "AbortError") {
      console.log("Request timed out");
    }
  })
  .finally(() => clearTimeout(timeout));
```

This cancels the request if it takes more than 5 seconds.

---

## Axios Timeout Support

Axios has built-in timeout configuration:

```ts
axios.get("/api/data", { timeout: 5000 })
  .then(handleResponse)
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error.code === "ECONNABORTED") {
      console.error("Request timed out");
    }
  });
```

This works cross-platform and handles error typing automatically.

---

## When Should You Set Timeouts?

Timeouts should be:
- Short for **UX-critical** tasks (e.g., button clicks, saves) — 3–5s
- Medium for **content fetching** (e.g., loading dashboards) — 5–10s
- Longer for **background syncing** or retries — 15–30s

Always balance:
- UX expectations
- Network variability
- Backend reliability
- Mobile vs desktop users

---

## UI Patterns for Timeout Feedback

- Use **spinners** with fallback text ("Taking longer than expected...")
- Auto-dismiss or retry on timeout
- Surface actionable errors ("Couldn’t connect — Try again")
- Use skeleton loaders to maintain layout continuity

---

## Timeout with Promises

You can create a timeout wrapper around any async function:

```ts
function withTimeout(promise, ms) {
  const timeout = new Promise((_, reject) =>
    setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Timeout")), ms)
  );
  return Promise.race([promise, timeout]);
}

withTimeout(fetch("/api/data"), 5000)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .catch(console.error);
```

This approach works with any async operation, not just network.

---

## Timeout and Retry Together

Combine timeouts with retries for resilience:

```ts
async function fetchWithRetry(url, attempts = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < attempts; i++) {
    try {
      return await withTimeout(fetch(url), 5000);
    } catch (e) {
      if (i === attempts - 1) throw e;
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures you give the request a fair chance — but don’t hang forever.

---

## Real-World Behavior

### Gmail

- Uses timeouts aggressively for inbox sync
- Prompts retry dialogs if fetch stalls

### Slack

- Marks channels as “disconnected” if request stalls > 5s
- Background retries to reconnect

### Facebook

- “We’re having trouble loading this right now” = timeout fallback
- Data fetches often retried silently

---

## Observability and Debugging

Track timeout stats:
- % of total requests that time out
- Avg time to timeout
- Affected endpoints
- Retry success rate

Use logs + error reporting (Sentry, DataDog) to alert on timeout spikes — often a backend issue or ISP degradation.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- No timeout on critical network ops (e.g. auth, save)
- Blindly retrying on timeout without exponential backoff
- Showing generic error messages for timeouts
- Canceling too aggressively on flaky mobile networks
- Letting stale timeouts override new requests (race condition)

---

## Conclusion: Better to Fail Fast Than Hang Forever

Timeouts make your app feel **intentional**. They say: “We expected this to work — and it didn’t — so we’ll move on.”

They protect your UX, save your compute, and help debug real-world issues.

So don’t just hope your fetches return.

Tell them **when to give up**.

And give your users something better than silence.
