# Adaptive Loading — Performance That Adapts to Real-World Devices

Not all users browse from the same place.

Some have fiber. Some have 3G. Some have gaming rigs. Others run Android Go on 8-year-old phones.

Modern web apps must not only be fast — they must be **smart enough to adapt**.

**Adaptive loading** means delivering different code, content, or behavior based on the user’s:
- Device capabilities
- Network speed
- Battery state
- User preferences

This strategy is core to building **inclusive, performant** apps for the real world.

---

## What Is Adaptive Loading?

Adaptive loading is:
- Delivering less JS to slow CPUs
- Skipping high-res images on metered networks
- Deferring effects when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set
- Lazy-loading or disabling features for constrained environments

---

## Why It Matters

- 70% of global users are on mid or low-end devices
- 60% of users browse over mobile connections
- JS execution time (parse, compile, run) is 5x slower on budget phones

Slow != bad user. It just means you need to optimize **differently**.

---

## Techniques

### Network Information API

```js
const connection = navigator.connection;

if (connection.saveData || connection.effectiveType === "2g") {
  loadLowResImages();
}
```

Detects slow or metered networks.

---

### Hardware-Based Bundle Splitting

Serve lighter bundles to low-end devices:

- Strip animations, optional polyfills, heavy components
- Use User-Agent or Client Hints

Example (Cloudflare Workers):

```js
if (isLowEndDevice(request)) {
  return fetch("/lite.bundle.js");
}
```

---

### prefers-reduced-motion

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation: none !important;
    transition: none !important;
  }
}
```

Respect users who want fewer animations.

---

### Lazy Load & Defer More Aggressively

Detect when CPU or memory is constrained and:
- Delay hydration of non-visible widgets
- Skip expensive charts or visualizations
- Load placeholders only

---

## Real-World Patterns

### YouTube Lite

- Loads placeholder thumbnails on slow networks
- Uses connection API + UA detection to switch behavior

### Facebook Lite

- JS bundle is 200KB instead of 1.3MB
- Fewer animations, simplified UI

### Twitter Lite

- Works even on 2G
- Adaptive font loading, offline mode, aggressive cache control

---

## Tooling

- `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` — # of logical CPUs
- `navigator.deviceMemory` — memory in GB (rounded)
- `navigator.connection` — network heuristics
- User-Agent + Cloud Rendering Edge Decisions (e.g. Cloudflare, Fastly)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Serving the same heavy SPA to everyone
- Animating complex visuals on low-powered GPUs
- Ignoring data-saver mode
- Not respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`

---

## Conclusion: Deliver the Right App for the Right Conditions

Performance isn’t just about being fast. It’s about being **context-aware**.

Adaptive loading lets you tailor your experience to your users — giving everyone what they need, when they need it.

And that’s what performance is really about:

Meeting users where they are.
