# DOM Batching & Minimizing — Less Changes, More Speed

The DOM is one of the slowest parts of the frontend stack.

Every time you touch it — via JavaScript, React, animations, or even CSS — you may trigger:
- Layout recalculations
- Style invalidations
- Paint
- Compositing

These steps are **expensive** and accumulate fast.

That’s why performance-oriented developers focus on **DOM batching** and **minimizing DOM updates**.

This guide explores:
- Why DOM updates are costly
- How browsers render
- Techniques for batching, minimizing, and sequencing DOM work
- React batching behavior
- Common anti-patterns and real-world advice

## The Browser Rendering Pipeline

1. JavaScript runs
2. DOM is updated
3. Styles recalculated
4. Layout (geometry) calculated
5. Paint → pixels drawn
6. Composite → sent to GPU

Each DOM change can trigger this process. Too many changes = low frame rate.

---

## What is DOM Batching?

**Batching** means grouping multiple DOM changes together to:
- Avoid layout thrashing
- Prevent redundant calculations
- Keep things in sync

---

## Example of Poor DOM Practice

```js
const el = document.getElementById("box");

el.style.width = "100px";
const height = el.offsetHeight; // layout forced
el.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```

This causes **forced layout + style + paint** for each step.

---

## Better: Batch DOM Access & Mutations

```js
const el = document.getElementById("box");

// READ phase
const height = el.offsetHeight;

// WRITE phase
el.style.width = "100px";
el.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```

Group all reads first, then all writes.

This avoids layout thrashing.

---

## React DOM Batching

React batches updates during event handlers and hooks.

```tsx
setCount(c => c + 1);
setFlag(f => !f);
```

Both updates run in one render.

In React 18+, batching is automatic even in `setTimeout` and promises.

```tsx
startTransition(() => {
  setState("slow update");
});
```

Use `useLayoutEffect` to **block** paint until your DOM updates are in place.

---

## Third-Party DOM Libraries

Avoid direct DOM manipulation (e.g., jQuery, anime.js) inside React apps unless:
- It’s fully isolated
- Batched in animation frames
- Doesn’t mutate React-managed DOM

---

## Scheduling with requestAnimationFrame

Use `requestAnimationFrame()` to align visual changes:

```js
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  element.style.transform = "translateY(100px)";
});
```

This syncs changes with browser paint.

## Real-World Examples

### Google Sheets

- Batches all cell updates into a single layer commit
- Uses canvas where possible to avoid DOM altogether

### Figma Web

- Renders most visuals via WebGL
- Batches React tree re-renders into a unified layer

### Gmail

- Uses `MutationObserver` to track and batch DOM changes from extensions

---

## Tools for Debugging

- Chrome DevTools → Performance → Layout → "Layout Shift", "Style Recalc"
- "Paint flashing" overlay
- `PerformanceObserver` API
- `why-did-you-render` for React components

---

## Anti-Patterns

- DOM read → write → read → write (thrashing)
- Triggering style/layout mid-transition
- Using uncontrolled animations on DOM-intensive views
- DOM mutation in `useEffect` without batching

---

## Conclusion: Touch the DOM Gently, Touch It Less

Optimizing DOM interactions is less about speed and more about **discipline**.

- Group changes
- Schedule paints
- Minimize reflows

Your users will feel the difference — even if they can’t see the code.

Because smoothness isn’t an accident. It’s the result of careful DOM stewardship.
