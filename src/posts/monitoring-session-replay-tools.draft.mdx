# Session Replay Tools — Watch What Your Users See

Imagine debugging a support ticket not with logs — but by literally **watching** what the user did.

What they clicked. What they hovered. What they typed. When the page glitched.

That’s what **session replay tools** provide: a playback of the user experience as it actually happened — DOM events, UI state, scrolls, inputs, errors, and more.

---

## What is Session Replay?

Session replay tools record the browser session in real-time by capturing:
- DOM mutations
- User events (clicks, inputs, scrolls)
- Network activity
- Console errors
- Performance metrics

They **reconstruct the session** in a sandboxed viewer so you can replay it like a video — with full interaction metadata.

It’s like having a security camera for your app.

## Why Use Session Replay?

### For Engineering

- Debug UI bugs you can’t reproduce
- See what triggered errors and stack traces
- Diagnose state mismatches or component failures

### For Product/UX

- Discover rage clicks, dead zones
- Analyze failed funnels
- Watch churn moments in real time

### For Support

- See exactly what the user did
- Reduce back-and-forth
- Attach sessions to support tickets

## Leading Tools

- **LogRocket**
- **FullStory**
- **Hotjar**
- **Smartlook**
- **SessionStack**
- **PostHog** (open source)

These tools often include:
- Heatmaps
- Funnels
- Console log recording
- Network request tracking
- DOM diffing

---

## How It Works (Under the Hood)

### DOM Recording

Uses MutationObserver to track DOM changes:
```js
const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
  // capture DOM diffs
});
observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });
```

### Event Capture

Hooks into native listeners:
- `click`, `input`, `keydown`, `scroll`, etc.
- Uses throttling + batching

### Replay Engine

- Rebuilds DOM from recorded diffs
- Plays back in an iframe or shadow DOM
- Syncs with logs and errors

---

## Security & Privacy

Session recording = potential risk.

### Mitigations:
- Mask sensitive fields (`email`, `password`, `credit card`)
- Use `inputMask` or `ignoreSelector` configs
- Anonymize or redact PII
- Don’t record keystrokes or clipboard
- Use strict data retention policies

Most tools offer:
- Visual masking
- GDPR/CCPA compliance modes
- In-region data storage

---

## Integration Example (LogRocket)

```html
<script>
  window.LogRocket && window.LogRocket.init('your-app-id');
</script>
```

Or in React:

```tsx
import LogRocket from 'logrocket';
LogRocket.init('your-org/your-app');
```

Connect with:
- Redux devtools
- Error tracking (e.g. Sentry)
- Auth/session IDs

---

## Real-World Examples

### Canva

- Tracks UI pain points in their complex editor
- Combines replay + logs for error root cause

### Coinbase

- Uses replay to triage support tickets
- Replays show device/browser-specific bugs

### Slack

- Internal replay tooling for crash reproduction
- Helps validate layout/render issues on legacy devices

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Recording without consent (GDPR violation)
- Exposing raw PII in sessions
- No sampling → performance issues
- Relying only on replay (no structured logs)

---

## Best Practices

- Mask sensitive fields (`input[type=password]`, `#ssn`)
- Use user/session IDs for linking with logs
- Sample by traffic volume or error type
- Limit replay retention to 30–90 days
- Integrate with error/logging dashboards

---

## Conclusion: Replay the Truth

Session replay doesn’t replace logs — it **augments them with narrative**.

It gives you context:
- Why the user clicked
- Where the UI broke
- What the experience really felt like

It’s empathy at scale — for your users and your debugging.
