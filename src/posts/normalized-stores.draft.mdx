# Normalized Stores ‚Äî Scaling State Like a Database

Frontend state starts simple. A counter. A user object. Maybe a few lists.

But once your app grows ‚Äî fetching paginated results, syncing updates across views, handling optimistic changes ‚Äî your state can spiral into a tangled mess of duplicated objects, stale data, and hard-to-follow mutations.

Enter **normalized stores**.

Inspired by relational databases and championed by tools like **Redux Toolkit**, **RTK Query**, **NgRx Entity**, and **Apollo Client**, normalized stores offer a way to **structure your client-side state like a database**, enabling reliable querying, easy cache updates, and scalable architecture.

## Why We Normalize State

Imagine a social media app. You fetch a user‚Äôs profile, and then separately fetch their posts. Now that user appears in both API responses ‚Äî one as a detailed object, and the other as a nested field inside posts.

What happens if you want to update their name?

Do you:
- Mutate all references manually?
- Refetch everything?
- Risk stale or out-of-sync state?

This is the crux of the problem. When state is denormalized ‚Äî meaning nested, repeated, and tightly coupled ‚Äî it becomes **harder to update, harder to track, and harder to scale**.

Normalization solves this by ensuring:
- Each entity exists in **one place**
- Relationships are stored by **ID reference**
- Updates are localized and composable

Just like a relational DB.

## What Normalized State Looks Like

Let‚Äôs say you have users and posts.

### Denormalized example:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "author": { "id": 42, "name": "Jane" },
      "content": "Hello world"
    }
  ]
}
```

If `name` changes, you need to update it **everywhere**.

### Normalized version:

```json
{
  "entities": {
    "users": {
      "42": { "id": 42, "name": "Jane" }
    },
    "posts": {
      "1": { "id": 1, "authorId": 42, "content": "Hello world" }
    }
  },
  "result": [1]
}
```

Now, `users[42]` is the **source of truth**. All components using it react to the same update ‚Äî no duplication, no stale data.

## Tools That Support Normalization

### Redux Toolkit (RTK)

Redux Toolkit‚Äôs `createEntityAdapter()` provides built-in normalization:

```ts
const usersAdapter = createEntityAdapter<User>();

const usersSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'users',
  initialState: usersAdapter.getInitialState(),
  reducers: {
    addUser: usersAdapter.addOne,
    updateUser: usersAdapter.updateOne,
  },
});
```

RTK Query also auto-normalizes responses by entity type, enabling efficient cache updates and background re-fetching.

### NgRx Entity

In Angular land, `NgRx Entity` provides similar adapters, selectors, and update patterns ‚Äî helping developers manage large datasets across routes and views.

### Apollo Client

Apollo stores entities by ID in its normalized in-memory cache, automatically resolving relationships and updating dependent queries when fields change.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Slack

Slack normalizes messages, users, and channels so that UI updates (like a new message or status change) reflect **across all panels** without duplication. The same user appears in message threads, member lists, and DMs ‚Äî all referencing the same store entry.

### Trello / Jira

Tools like Trello normalize cards, lists, and users to manage complex drag-and-drop workflows without rebinding entire trees of nested state. A card move updates one entry ‚Äî not the whole list.

### GitHub (Issues, Comments, Repos)

A normalized cache makes it easy to update a single comment or label across issue pages, notifications, and dashboards, keeping the UI consistent without massive re-renders.

## Benefits of Normalization

- üß† Clear, consistent data shape
- üîÅ Easier updates and merging of new data
- üîç Efficient caching and reactivity
- üß© Reusable selectors
- ‚öñÔ∏è Supports pagination, optimistic updates, and background syncing
- üßº Avoids stale, orphaned, or duplicated state

---

## Challenges and Tradeoffs

- More upfront setup: adapters, ID mapping, relational logic
- Requires ID consistency in API responses
- Querying relationships can feel verbose without selectors
- Debugging can be trickier in deeply nested references
- Custom UI needs thoughtful selector design to avoid over-fetching

Still, for apps with complex relationships ‚Äî or any app that touches the same data from many views ‚Äî normalization is a **foundational design pattern**.

---

## Best Practices

- Use `createEntityAdapter()` or `normalizr` to abstract data transforms
- Keep `entities` and `ids` separate in state slices
- Write selectors that resolve relationships: `selectPostWithAuthor(postId)`
- Normalize at the API layer if possible (e.g. RTK Query transformResponse)
- Don‚Äôt over-normalize ‚Äî primitive one-off values can stay flat

## Conclusion: Design Like a Database

Frontend state isn‚Äôt just a temporary object store. As apps scale, state becomes **the frontend‚Äôs internal database**. It deserves the same structure, discipline, and care as a backend schema.

Normalized stores provide that structure. They empower apps to scale gracefully, reduce duplication, and stay predictable ‚Äî even when data flows get complex.

Build your state like you'd build a database.

Because, at scale, that‚Äôs exactly what it becomes.
