# Heading Hierarchy for SEO — Structure That Search Engines Love

Headings are the backbone of content structure — for **humans** and **search engines** alike.

Using `<h1>` through `<h6>` in a clear, hierarchical way:
- Makes content more scannable
- Improves semantic clarity
- Helps search engines extract **page structure** and **topics**
- Enhances screen reader navigation

In this article, we’ll dive into:
- Why heading hierarchy matters for SEO
- How search engines interpret headings
- Best practices and common mistakes
- Tools and techniques for better structure

## Why Headings Matter for SEO

Search engines use headings to:
- Build a **document outline**
- Understand main topics and subtopics
- Infer importance and context
- Help generate featured snippets

A clear heading structure improves:
- **Relevance signals**
- **Indexing**
- **Rich results extraction**

---

## HTML Heading Tags: `<h1>` to `<h6>`

Use headings to reflect the **semantic structure**, not just style.

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
  <h2>Subsection A</h2>
    <h3>Detail under A</h3>
  <h2>Subsection B</h2>
```

Avoid skipping levels (e.g., `<h1>` → `<h4>`) unless structurally correct.

---

## One `<h1>` Per Page

Historically, SEO best practice = one `<h1>` per page.

With HTML5, multiple `<h1>`s are allowed in different sectioning contexts, but:
- Most crawlers still prefer **one main `<h1>`**
- Keep it consistent and unique
- Use it for the **page’s primary purpose**

---

## Best Practices

- Use **only one `<h1>`** unless sectioning semantics justify more
- Nest headings correctly (no skipping levels)
- Don’t use headings for visual layout only
- Make headings **descriptive and keyword-rich**, but not spammy
- Keep a consistent visual style for each heading level

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Using `<div class="heading">` instead of actual heading tags
- Styling `<h4>` to look like `<h2>` (breaks semantics)
- Repeating the same heading multiple times
- Skipping heading levels (`<h2>` → `<h4>`)
- Putting headings inside interactive elements

- Cognitive users who scan content visually

---

## Conclusion: Your Outline Is Your Opportunity

A clean heading hierarchy is more than semantic polish — it’s **strategic SEO**.

It shows Google what your content means, how it’s structured, and why it matters.

So write your headings like you’d outline a talk:
- One main idea
- Supporting sections
- Clear, nested logic

That’s how you turn content into **context** — and context into **clicks**.
