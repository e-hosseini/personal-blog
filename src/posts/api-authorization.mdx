# API Authorization — Controlling What Users Can Do

If authentication answers the question *“Who are you?”*, then **authorization** answers the more important one: *“What are you allowed to do?”*

In an API-first world, authorization is not just about access control — it’s about defining trust boundaries across users, roles, teams, organizations, and systems. It determines which records are visible, which actions are allowed, and which behaviors are blocked entirely.

Poorly implemented authorization can lead to:
- Data leaks
- Escalation of privileges
- Accidental deletions
- Security vulnerabilities across tenants or domains

In this article, we’ll explore the landscape of modern API authorization: from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), permission systems, scopes, and how leading platforms design scalable, auditable access logic.

## The Evolution of Authorization

In early web apps, authorization was often hardcoded:
```js
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  allowDelete = true;
}
```

As systems matured, this evolved into centralized policy systems, where permissions could be configured per user or group, abstracted away from business logic, and managed by non-developers.

Today, APIs support:
- User-level scopes (OAuth)
- Role-based rules (RBAC)
- Contextual access (ABAC)
- Row-level filtering (e.g. only see your org’s data)
- Fine-grained policy engines (like OPA or Casbin)

Authorization has become a first-class architectural concern — especially in multi-tenant and B2B platforms.

---

## Key Concepts in API Authorization

- **Subject**: the user or identity (e.g. `user_123`)
- **Action**: what they want to do (e.g. `read`, `write`, `delete`)
- **Resource**: the thing being acted on (e.g. `invoice:567`)
- **Context**: conditions (e.g. IP, time, org ID)

Authorization is the decision: *Is this subject allowed to perform this action on this resource in this context?*

---

## Authorization Models

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Users are assigned roles (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`), and roles map to permissions.

Pros:
- Simple and predictable
- Easy to model in UI
- Good for small teams

Cons:
- Rigid and coarse-grained
- Role explosion in complex orgs

Used by: GitHub (collaborator roles), Notion (workspace roles)

---

### 2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Decisions based on **attributes** of user, resource, or environment:
```json
{
  "user.department": "HR",
  "resource.type": "document",
  "action": "view"
}
```

Pros:
- Very flexible
- Context-aware
- Enables policies like "can view documents if in same department"

Cons:
- Harder to debug and audit
- Requires structured metadata

Used by: Firebase, AWS IAM, enterprise policy engines

---

### 3. Permission-Based Access Control

Directly assign permissions to users:
```json
{
  "can_create_invoice": true,
  "can_read_orders": false
}
```

Fine-grained, dynamic, and easy to audit. Often implemented as bitmasks or policy flags.

Used by: Stripe, Linear, internal enterprise systems

---

## Scopes in OAuth

In OAuth2, scopes define what an access token can do:
```http
scope=read:user write:repos
```

Used to:
- Limit token power
- Prevent over-privilege
- Enable consent prompts

Tokens can be issued with minimal scopes and escalated when needed.

---

## Row-Level Authorization

Many APIs need to limit access to **specific records**:
- Only view invoices you own
- Only edit users in your org
- Only delete files you uploaded

Patterns include:
- Foreign keys tied to `user_id` or `org_id`
- Middleware filtering queries (`SELECT ... WHERE org_id = $1`)
- Post-query sanitization (filtering unauthorized data)

Row-level security is essential in **multi-tenant apps**.

---

## Authorization in GraphQL

GraphQL doesn't have built-in authorization — you enforce it in resolvers.

Common patterns:
- Inject user into context
- Write guards for each resolver
- Use directives like `@requiresRole("admin")`
- Apply filtering in data sources (e.g. Prisma, Hasura)

Example (Apollo Server):
```js
if (!user || !user.canView(resourceId)) {
  throw new ForbiddenError("You don't have access");
}
```

---

## Real-World Systems

### GitHub

- Scopes for token permissions
- Roles for org repos
- 403 for unauthorized access
- 404 for hidden resources (security by obscurity)

### Stripe

- Permissions per key
- Connected accounts inherit access scopes
- Idempotency and metadata to restrict operations

### Firebase

- ABAC-style rules
- User metadata + document paths determine access
- Used for mobile/web apps with granular needs

---

## Best Practices

- Keep auth logic centralized and testable
- Use declarative policies where possible
- Scope tokens and sessions tightly
- Avoid mixing auth checks with business logic
- Log all access decisions for audit trails
- Use policy-as-code tools (OPA, Cedar, Casbin) for complex orgs

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Checking roles directly in business code
- Overuse of “admin” bypasses
- Ignoring row-level needs (e.g., `SELECT *`)
- Granting all-or-nothing permissions
- Using 200 OK for unauthorized access

---

## Conclusion: Authorization is Trust, Codified

Authorization isn’t a checkbox — it’s a **living system** that protects your users, their data, and your platform. It's a contract between your code and your customers.

It must be:
- Auditable
- Flexible
- Composable
- Secure

Build it early, evolve it continuously, and treat it with the gravity it deserves.

Because what users can do is often more important than who they are.
