# Sitemaps — Guiding Crawlers Through Your Website

Your site could have the best content on the web — but if search engines can't **discover** your pages, they won’t show up in results.

A **sitemap** fixes that.

Sitemaps tell search engines what pages exist, where they are, and how often they change. They’re a roadmap for bots like Googlebot, ensuring your content gets crawled and indexed.

This article covers:
- What sitemaps are and why they matter
- XML and alternative formats
- Dynamic vs static generation
- How to submit and validate sitemaps
- Real-world examples and tooling

## What Is a Sitemap?

A **sitemap** is a file (usually XML) that lists the URLs on your site, along with metadata:
- Last modified date
- Change frequency
- Priority (hint for importance)

Placed at `/sitemap.xml`, it helps crawlers find **every reachable page**, even ones with few or no inbound links.

---

## Sitemap XML Format

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://example.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2023-01-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

- `loc` = full URL
- `lastmod` = last modified date (optional)
- `changefreq` = hint for update frequency
- `priority` = 0.0–1.0 (optional)

---

## When Do You Need a Sitemap?

- Your site has **lots of pages**
- You have **pages not linked** in the UI
- You use **dynamic routing** (e.g., SPAs)
- You want to ensure **crawling completeness**

Even simple sites benefit — sitemaps are supported by Google, Bing, and others.

---

## Dynamic vs Static Sitemaps

### Static

Generated once via CLI or CMS plugin.

Great for:
- Blogs
- Marketing sites

### Dynamic

Generated on request (e.g., `/api/sitemap.xml`).

Great for:
- Ecommerce
- Apps with user-generated content
- Headless CMS or Jamstack

---

## Sitemap Generation in Modern Frameworks

### Next.js

Use `next-sitemap`:

```bash
npm install next-sitemap
```

```js
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: 'https://example.com',
  generateRobotsTxt: true,
};
```

### Astro

Use `@astrojs/sitemap` integration to auto-generate at build time.

---

## Robots.txt and Sitemaps

Always include your sitemap in `robots.txt`:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:

Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

This ensures crawlers find your sitemap even without Search Console.

---

## Submit to Google Search Console

1. Go to **Index → Sitemaps**
2. Enter your sitemap URL
3. Monitor status, errors, and discoverability

This improves crawl priority and diagnostics.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Amazon

- Thousands of sitemap index files
- Each product category has separate sitemap

### MDN

- Updated nightly
- Includes language versions of each doc

### Medium

- Auto-updated sitemaps per user blog

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Stale sitemap URLs (returning 404)
- Missing new pages (e.g., blog posts)
- Using wrong date format in `<lastmod>`
- Forgetting to regenerate after content updates

---

## Tools

- Screaming Frog SEO Spider
- `next-sitemap`, `gatsby-plugin-sitemap`, `xmlbuilder2`
- Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools

---

## Conclusion: Be Crawler-Friendly

A sitemap is your site’s handshake to the bots that power discovery.

Help them out.

List everything. Keep it current. Submit it properly.

Because the only thing worse than bad SEO is **great content no one can find**.
