# RESTful APIs ‚Äî The Backbone of Web Data Exchange

Before GraphQL, gRPC, and RPC-over-WebSocket, there was REST ‚Äî and it‚Äôs still the most widely used API standard today.

RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) define a **uniform interface** over HTTP for exchanging resources. REST popularized the idea that everything ‚Äî users, comments, products, orders ‚Äî is a **resource**, and each resource has a URL, methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and a structured representation, usually JSON.

It‚Äôs more than just convention ‚Äî it‚Äôs architecture. And understanding REST deeply is essential for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable frontend systems.

## Why REST Was Invented

In the early 2000s, most web APIs were built using SOAP ‚Äî a verbose, XML-based RPC protocol. SOAP was powerful but rigid and over-engineered for most use cases.

In 2000, Roy Fielding‚Äôs dissertation introduced **REST**, proposing a simpler way to build distributed systems using existing web protocols ‚Äî especially HTTP. REST emphasized:
- **Statelessness**: every request is independent
- **Resources**: everything addressable by URL
- **Uniform interface**: HTTP verbs + status codes
- **Cacheability**: responses can be cached
- **Layered system**: support for proxies, CDNs

REST caught fire in the 2010s as web services exploded ‚Äî becoming the de facto API pattern for startups and enterprises alike.

## Anatomy of a RESTful API

Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre building a blogging platform.

| Action         | HTTP Verb | Endpoint          |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Get all posts  | GET       | /api/posts        |
| Get one post   | GET       | /api/posts/:id    |
| Create post    | POST      | /api/posts        |
| Update post    | PUT       | /api/posts/:id    |
| Delete post    | DELETE    | /api/posts/:id    |

Data is typically sent/received as JSON:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "REST is not dead",
  "author": "Ada",
  "tags": ["http", "architecture"]
}
```

Good REST APIs also follow conventions for:
- **Pagination** (`?page=2&limit=10`)
- **Filtering** (`?tag=react`)
- **Sorting** (`?sort=created_at`)
- **Field selection** (`?fields=id,title,author`)
- **Status codes** (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`)

## Real-World REST in Practice

### GitHub API

GitHub‚Äôs v3 API is RESTful and follows clean conventions:
- Authentication via OAuth or personal tokens
- Standard pagination headers
- Media types for previews and custom MIME types

### Stripe

Stripe‚Äôs API design is admired across the industry:
- Predictable, elegant endpoint structure
- Consistent response formats and error objects
- Idempotent keys for safe retries

### Twitter

Twitter‚Äôs REST API v1.1 served billions of requests per day with streaming, filters, and timeline pagination ‚Äî before moving to GraphQL internally.

## Strengths of REST

- ‚úÖ Simple to understand and debug
- ‚úÖ Works with every HTTP client and CDN
- ‚úÖ Native support for caching (via ETags, 304 Not Modified)
- ‚úÖ Great for public APIs and resource-driven UIs
- ‚úÖ Strong documentation and tooling ecosystem

---

## Limitations

- üöß Overfetching / underfetching ‚Äî especially in mobile
- üö´ Lacks native support for real-time updates
- üîÅ Can be verbose with deeply nested resources
- üîç Requires extra endpoints for non-resource queries
- üîê Statelessness makes some workflows (e.g., transactions) tricky

These limitations are what led to the rise of **GraphQL**, **RPC**, and **realtime APIs** ‚Äî but REST still dominates due to its simplicity and ubiquity.

---

## Frontend Integration Patterns

- Use tools like **Axios**, **SWR**, or **React Query** to abstract and cache requests
- Normalize entities on receipt (see [Normalized Stores](/normalized-stores))
- Cache responses with `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, or HTTP headers
- Handle 4xx and 5xx responses gracefully with retry logic
- Respect rate limits and backoff headers

## REST vs GraphQL

| Feature             | REST         | GraphQL       |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Resource granularity| Per endpoint | Per query     |
| Overfetching        | Common       | Rare          |
| Underfetching       | Requires joins | Rare        |
| Caching             | HTTP native  | Needs tooling |
| Real-time           | Needs polling| Subscriptions |
| Learning curve      | Low          | Medium        |

REST is better for simple, well-defined, cacheable APIs. GraphQL shines for complex, nested, or client-driven data needs.

## Conclusion: REST Isn‚Äôt Dead ‚Äî It‚Äôs Foundational

REST isn‚Äôt a buzzword ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bedrock. Whether you're building React apps, connecting to microservices, or designing headless CMS integrations, REST gives you a predictable, stable, and powerful way to structure communication between systems.

Yes, GraphQL and other protocols have expanded our toolset.

But REST? It‚Äôs still the most universal language on the web.

And it‚Äôs here to stay.
