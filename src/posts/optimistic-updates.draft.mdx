# Optimistic Updates — Making Your UI Feel Instant

In a perfect world, network requests would be instant. But in reality, even a 300ms delay feels sluggish when you're clicking, typing, or dragging. That's why **optimistic updates** exist.

Instead of waiting for the server to confirm that something has happened — like saving a comment, liking a post, or updating a title — we **immediately reflect the change in the UI**, assuming it will succeed. If it doesn’t, we roll it back.

This simple idea can drastically improve perceived performance and user experience. It makes apps feel **snappy**, **responsive**, and **native-quality**.

In this article, we’ll go deep into:
- How optimistic updates work
- When to use them (and when not to)
- Real-world examples from top products
- Patterns with React Query, SWR, Redux, and beyond
- Dealing with failures, revalidation, and race conditions

## What Are Optimistic Updates?

An optimistic update is a **speculative UI change** — the frontend behaves as if a mutation succeeded before getting a server response.

Example: The user likes a tweet → the heart icon fills instantly → request is sent → server responds later.

If the request fails, the UI **rolls back** or shows an error.

Optimistic updates are part of the broader principle of **optimistic concurrency control** — assume success, correct on failure.

---

## Why It Matters

- Eliminates perceived latency
- Aligns with real-world expectations (touch feels instant)
- Improves trust in responsiveness
- Prevents flickers and loading spinners
- Keeps app snappy even on mobile or slow connections

Without optimistic updates:
- The UI freezes waiting for confirmation
- Loading states disrupt UX flow
- Interactions feel sluggish or broken

---

## Implementation Example (React + Mutation)

```tsx
const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);

const handleLike = () => {
  setLiked(true); // optimistic update

  fetch("/api/like", { method: "POST" })
    .then(res => {
      if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed");
    })
    .catch(() => {
      setLiked(false); // rollback
    });
};
```

The UI is **immediately responsive**, and the rollback handles rare errors.

---

## With React Query

```tsx
const mutation = useMutation(sendLike, {
  onMutate: async (newData) => {
    await queryClient.cancelQueries("likes");

    const previous = queryClient.getQueryData("likes");
    queryClient.setQueryData("likes", old => [...old, newData]);

    return { previous };
  },
  onError: (err, newData, context) => {
    queryClient.setQueryData("likes", context.previous);
  },
  onSettled: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries("likes");
  }
});
```

Here we:
- Cancel in-flight queries
- Store the previous state
- Apply the optimistic change
- Rollback on failure
- Revalidate on success

---

## With SWR

```tsx
mutate("/api/posts", async (prev) => {
  const optimistic = [...prev, newPost];
  await fetch("/api/posts", { method: "POST", body: JSON.stringify(newPost) });
  return optimistic;
}, { optimisticData: [...data, newPost], rollbackOnError: true });
```

SWR makes optimistic UI logic declarative and rollback safe.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

### Twitter

- Likes, retweets, bookmarks update instantly
- Backend reconciles later and can silently correct the UI

### Notion

- Every keystroke is optimistic
- Updates are synced in the background and merged

### GitHub

- Issue reactions, comments, PR merges are optimistic
- Keeps interaction fast while preserving eventual consistency

---

## Risks and Tradeoffs

- If the server rejects the mutation, the user may see **UI inconsistency**
- Requires **rollback logic** and cached state
- Race conditions can corrupt data if not handled
- User may interact with stale or temporary state

Best mitigations:
- Ensure deterministic mutation logic
- Use unique local IDs to track temp items
- Limit optimistic updates to **safe, idempotent actions**

---

## Good Patterns

- Save a snapshot of current state before mutation
- Apply local UI update
- Try server call in parallel
- Rollback only if necessary
- Revalidate on confirmation

Avoid blocking logic — treat server confirmation as **asynchronous validation**, not a blocker.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Optimistically updating **critical data** (passwords, balances)
- Failing to rollback on mutation errors
- Updating UI with **derived state** (instead of cached source)
- Replacing entire lists (breaks concurrent updates)
- Stacking multiple mutations with no rollback tracking

---

## Conclusion: UX that Feels Like Magic

Optimistic updates blur the line between **frontend and backend** — and when done right, the user can’t tell the difference.

It’s a mindset:
- Trust the user
- Trust the system
- Prioritize responsiveness

Because waiting for the server is fine.

But **feeling like you didn’t have to wait at all** — that’s delightful.

And delight wins.
