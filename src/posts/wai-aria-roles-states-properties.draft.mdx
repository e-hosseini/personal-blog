# WAI-ARIA Roles, States & Properties — Making Semantic HTML Smarter

HTML alone isn’t always enough.

Modern web apps use tabs, modals, carousels, live updates — patterns that **aren’t natively supported** in semantic HTML. That’s where **WAI-ARIA** comes in.

ARIA stands for **Accessible Rich Internet Applications**, and it’s a set of attributes that add:
- Meaning (`role`)
- Status (`aria-*`)
- Interactivity (`aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, etc.)

These attributes allow **screen readers** and other assistive tech to understand and announce complex UIs.

In this guide, we’ll explore:
- The purpose of ARIA
- When and how to use roles, states, and properties
- Examples of ARIA-powered components
- Common mistakes (and how to avoid them)

---

## The First Rule of ARIA

> **Don’t use ARIA if you can use native HTML.**

HTML5 already provides semantic elements:
- Use `<button>`, not `div role="button"`
- Use `<nav>`, not `div role="navigation"`
- Use `<h1>` to `<h6>`, not `div role="heading"`

ARIA should **enhance**, not replace, semantic HTML.

---

## ARIA Roles

ARIA roles describe the **purpose** of an element.

Examples:
- `role="button"`
- `role="dialog"`
- `role="tabpanel"`
- `role="alert"`
- `role="navigation"`

### Tab Example:

```html
<div role="tablist">
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="true">Home</button>
  <button role="tab" aria-selected="false">Profile</button>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel">Tab content here</div>
```

---

## ARIA States

ARIA states describe **current conditions** like:
- `aria-checked` (checkbox)
- `aria-expanded` (menus, accordions)
- `aria-disabled` (non-interactive states)

```html
<button aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="menu">Menu</button>
<ul id="menu" hidden>...</ul>
```

Update states **dynamically** via JS when interaction changes.

---

## ARIA Properties

ARIA properties describe **relationships and descriptions**:
- `aria-labelledby`
- `aria-describedby`
- `aria-controls`

### Modal Example:

```html
<div role="dialog" aria-labelledby="dialog-title" aria-describedby="dialog-desc">
  <h2 id="dialog-title">Delete item</h2>
  <p id="dialog-desc">Are you sure?</p>
</div>
```

This links the heading and description to the dialog for screen readers.

---

## Live Regions

Dynamic content? Use ARIA live regions to **announce updates**.

```html
<div role="status" aria-live="polite">Saving...</div>
```

Values:
- `polite` — announce when idle
- `assertive` — announce immediately (e.g., error messages)

---

## Labeling Elements

Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for non-text elements:

```html
<button aria-label="Close menu">
  <svg>...</svg>
</button>
```

Avoid using images/icons without labels.

---

## Complex Components

Use ARIA when building:
- Tabs, sliders, trees, accordions
- Modals, alerts, tooltips
- Menus, comboboxes, multiselect lists

Frameworks like React Aria, Reach UI, and Radix already handle this — or copy their patterns.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- `div role="button"` with no keyboard support
- `aria-hidden="true"` on visible elements
- Incorrect role hierarchy (`tab` outside `tablist`)
- Using ARIA instead of fixing bad HTML
- Forgetting to update `aria-*` states dynamically

---

## Real-World Usage

### GitHub

- Uses `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` in dropdowns
- Live region announcements in issue comments

### Airbnb

- Dialogs use `role="dialog"` with properly labeled headings
- Interactive filters enhanced with `aria-pressed` and `aria-checked`

## Tools for Testing

- Chrome Accessibility Tree
- Axe DevTools
- Lighthouse → Accessibility audit
- VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS

## Conclusion: Speak the Language of Assistive Tech

ARIA is a bridge between your UI and the tools that help people use it.

Used right, it enhances. Used wrong, it confuses.

Stick with native HTML when possible. Add ARIA when needed. And test, test, test.

Because accessibility isn’t about attributes — it’s about communication.
