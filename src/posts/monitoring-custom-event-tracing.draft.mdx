# Custom Event Tracing — Observe What Matters to You

Performance metrics are great — but sometimes, you want to know **what happens when a user clicks that specific button**, or **how long a search really takes**, or **which API fails in a specific flow**.

That’s where **Custom Event Tracing** comes in.

It’s the ability to define, record, and analyze **domain-specific events** in your frontend:
- "User clicked Add to Cart"
- "Search query → results rendered"
- "Login → redirect completed"

With custom tracing, you **measure what your users care about**, not just what the browser exposes.

---

## Why You Need Custom Tracing

- Generic metrics don’t reflect **business context**
- RUM and Web Vitals don’t show internal performance breakdowns
- You need visibility into **UX flows**, not just resource timings

Examples:
- Did checkout complete?
- Was search responsive?
- How long did onboarding take?

---

## Anatomy of a Custom Trace

A trace has:
- **Name**: `checkout_complete`, `api_call_start`, etc.
- **Timestamps**: Start and end
- **Metadata**: User info, environment, payload
- **Span or correlation ID**: Optional, for distributed trace linking

You log these traces to:
- Internal logging APIs
- Observability tools (e.g. Datadog, Sentry, Elastic)
- Console (for debug)

---

## Basic Implementation

```js
function traceEvent(name, metadata = {}) {
  const start = performance.now();
  return {
    end: () => {
      const end = performance.now();
      sendToBackend({
        name,
        duration: end - start,
        ...metadata,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### Usage

```js
const trace = traceEvent("add_to_cart", { productId: 123 });
// ... do stuff
trace.end();
```

---

## Tracing Page Flows

```js
performance.mark("search-start");
fetch("/api/search?q=query")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(() => {
    performance.mark("search-end");
    performance.measure("search-duration", "search-start", "search-end");
  });
```

---

## Instrumenting Business Logic

- Checkout span from click → confirmation
- Modal load latency
- Multi-step flows (onboarding, surveys)

### React example:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const trace = traceEvent("onboarding_step_1_start");
  return () => trace.end();
}, []);
```

---

## Where to Send the Data

- `navigator.sendBeacon()` for async logs
- `fetch()` + batching
- Log to Sentry/Datadog/NewRelic with `trace_id`
- Self-hosted Prometheus-compatible endpoint

---

## Real-World Example: Stripe

- Traces every payment flow: from button click to transaction result
- Custom spans for fraud checks, card verification
- End-to-end correlation with backend latency

### GitHub

- Traces code loading, comment submission
- Real-time logs grouped by user session

---

## Anti-Patterns

- No unique IDs (can't correlate spans)
- Tracing everything (causes noise)
- Tracing without timestamps
- Logging too late (miss early interactions)
- Missing user context (route, browser, device)

---

## Conclusion: Track What You Build

Custom event tracing gives you **ownership over observability**.

You’re not guessing why the UX feels slow. You’re measuring it.

From cart to checkout. From search to result. From interaction to insight.

Build your own map — and **trace your product, not just your code**.
