# Rendering Strategies Compared — CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, RSC, and More

Modern frontend frameworks give us many rendering options. Each comes with tradeoffs in speed, interactivity, SEO, and scalability. But with so many acronyms — CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR, RSC — it can be difficult to know which is right for which part of your app.

This article breaks down the major rendering strategies available today, **why they exist**, and **how they evolved** to solve specific problems. Whether you're building a marketing site, dashboard, storefront, or content platform, choosing the right rendering model is one of the most strategic decisions you'll make.

## The Evolution of Rendering

In the early web, everything was rendered server-side. HTML was built with PHP, Rails, or Java on the server, sent to the client, and that was it. JavaScript was optional — progressive enhancement was the norm.

Then came Single Page Applications (SPAs). These shifted all rendering to the client using frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue. This gave us interactivity and rich UX — but hurt SEO and cold-start performance.

Frameworks responded by introducing hybrid rendering strategies — mixing static, dynamic, and server-driven techniques. React Server Components, Streaming, and Progressive Hydration are the latest in this line of evolution.

## 1. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

**How it works:** The server sends a barebones HTML shell. The JavaScript bundle loads, fetches data, and renders the UI client-side.

**Pros:**
- Full interactivity
- Great for dashboards and apps behind login
- Offline capabilities with service workers

**Cons:**
- Blank screen on first load
- SEO-unfriendly by default
- Bundle size is critical

**Use for:** Authenticated dashboards, internal tools, real-time apps

---

## 2. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

**How it works:** HTML is rendered on the server at request time and sent to the client. JavaScript hydrates the page afterward.

**Pros:**
- SEO-friendly
- Faster first paint than CSR
- Dynamic content support

**Cons:**
- Higher server load
- Slower TTFB than static
- Needs hydration logic

**Use for:** Marketing pages, content portals, e-commerce PDPs

---

## 3. Static Site Generation (SSG)

**How it works:** HTML is pre-rendered at build time for all routes and stored as static files.

**Pros:**
- Blazing-fast performance
- Fully cacheable
- Zero server cost

**Cons:**
- Requires rebuild to update
- Not ideal for dynamic data
- Long builds for large sites

**Use for:** Blogs, documentation, low-change landing pages

---

## 4. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

**How it works:** Like SSG, but pages are regenerated on demand after a TTL window or via API/webhook.

**Pros:**
- Combines static speed with fresh content
- Avoids full rebuilds
- Scales well for large catalogs

**Cons:**
- More infra complexity
- Possible cache staleness

**Use for:** E-commerce, content platforms, dynamic but SEO-sensitive pages

---

## 5. React Server Components (RSC)

**How it works:** Components run on the server and send serialized UI to the client. Only client-labeled components are hydrated.

**Pros:**
- Reduced bundle size
- Seamless data fetching
- Minimal client JS for non-interactive parts

**Cons:**
- Ecosystem is early
- No access to browser APIs
- Complexity in mixing client/server components

**Use for:** Modern fullstack apps with mixed interactivity

---

## 6. Streaming

**How it works:** HTML is streamed progressively as components render. Works with SSR and RSC.

**Pros:**
- Fast FCP
- Non-blocking data loading
- Better performance on slow networks

**Cons:**
- Requires server/edge support
- Suspense boundaries must be designed carefully

**Use for:** Content-heavy or nested apps, article pages, storefronts

## Conclusion: Strategic Composition

There’s no single “best” rendering strategy. The smartest teams **compose** their architecture from multiple techniques:

- Use **SSG** or **ISR** for content-heavy, SEO-critical pages
- Use **SSR + Streaming** for dynamic content
- Use **CSR** for authenticated or real-time features
- Use **RSC** and **Partial Hydration** to reduce bundle size
- Use **Edge Functions** to personalize at scale

Choose based on your **users**, your **infrastructure**, and your **business goals** — not just developer familiarity.

Your rendering strategy is your UX strategy.

Make it count.
