# CORS — Controlling Cross-Origin Requests

Modern web apps often communicate across domains — your frontend might be on `app.com`, but your backend API lives at `api.com`.

Browsers treat these as different **origins**. And for security, they enforce a strict rule:
> JavaScript can’t make cross-origin requests unless the server explicitly allows it.

This is **CORS** — Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

---

## Why CORS Exists

CORS protects users from malicious websites that attempt to:
- Read sensitive data from other origins
- Call APIs the user is authenticated against
- Exploit CSRF-like attacks via XHR or fetch

Without CORS, **any page could call any API** and read the response using the user’s credentials.

---

## What Counts as “Cross-Origin”?

Origins are defined by **scheme + domain + port**.

Examples:
- `https://api.example.com` ≠ `https://example.com`
- `http://localhost:3000` ≠ `http://localhost:5000`
- `https://example.com` ≠ `http://example.com`

Even the same domain with a different protocol or port is considered **cross-origin**.

---

## CORS in Action

### Simple Request

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
```

The browser checks:
- Is the method `GET`, `POST`, or `HEAD`?
- Are the headers simple (no custom headers)?
- Is the response allowed via `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`?

If allowed:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.example.com
```

---

## Preflight Requests

If a request:
- Uses methods like `PUT`, `DELETE`
- Sends custom headers
- Has a content type like `application/json`

Then the browser sends a **preflight** request:

```http
OPTIONS /data HTTP/1.1
Origin: https://frontend.example.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
```

The server must respond with:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

---

## Allowing Credentials

To allow cookies, use:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

And the frontend must explicitly enable:

```js
fetch(url, { credentials: "include" });
```

Note: When using credentials, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` **cannot** be `*`.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` while also using cookies
- Forgetting to respond to `OPTIONS` requests
- Allowing origins dynamically **without validation** (e.g. `res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin)`)
- Not setting `Vary: Origin` — which can break caching

---

## CORS Configuration Examples

### Express.js (Node)

```js
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors({
  origin: "https://frontend.example.com",
  credentials: true
}));
```

### NGINX

```nginx
location /api/ {
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://frontend.example.com;
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true;
}
```

---

## Real-World Example: Stripe

Stripe’s API only allows CORS for:
- Public `fetch()` APIs (e.g., Elements, webhooks)
- Origins that are part of Stripe’s official frontend products

Requests from arbitrary websites to `https://api.stripe.com` are **blocked** unless explicitly supported.

---

## Tools for Debugging

- Chrome DevTools → Network → XHR → Headers/Console
- CORS Anywhere (for testing with proxies)
- Postman (no CORS enforcement)
- curl (simulate request headers)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Allowing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on authenticated endpoints
- Ignoring preflight headers
- Not responding to OPTIONS with correct CORS headers
- Not logging failed origin checks

---

## Conclusion: Trust, but Verify

CORS is the browser’s built-in firewall. It’s there to prevent silent data leaks, token theft, and credential abuse.

As a frontend dev:
- Know what your API server expects
- Understand what triggers preflight
- Test every fetch, not just in dev

And as a backend dev:
- Whitelist trusted origins
- Treat CORS as a security boundary — because it is.
