# Memory Leaks — The Silent Killers of Frontend Performance

Your app starts fast. A few tabs later, it slows. Scroll stutters. RAM usage climbs.

Sound familiar?

That’s a memory leak.

In frontend engineering, **memory leaks** are stealthy performance killers. They don’t crash your app — they **erode** it. Every click, every page, every component mounts something... and never unmounts it. Or worse — it never lets it go.

In this article, we’ll explore:
- What memory leaks are and how they happen
- Common causes in JavaScript and React
- Tools to detect leaks in DevTools
- Best practices to avoid them in the first place

## What Is a Memory Leak?

A memory leak happens when memory that’s no longer needed **isn’t released**.

In a garbage-collected language like JavaScript, you don’t free memory manually. But memory is only garbage-collected when **nothing references it**.

Leaked memory is:
- Retained in closures
- Trapped in listeners or timers
- Stuck in hidden globals
- Or held by detached DOM nodes

---

## Signs You Have a Leak

- Gradual slowdown over time
- Increasing memory usage in Chrome Task Manager
- Tabs that never release memory
- Event handlers firing on unmounted components
- Users reporting “feels sluggish after a while”

---

## Common Causes

### 1. Forgotten Timeouts and Intervals

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => doStuff(), 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id);
}, []);
```

Without `clearInterval`, memory and CPU are consumed **forever**.

---

### 2. Event Listeners on Window or DOM

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener("resize", handler);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handler);
}, []);
```

If not removed, listeners accumulate with every mount.

---

### 3. Closures Capturing State

```tsx
let store = [];

function addToStore(item) {
  store.push(item);
}
```

If `store` grows forever and is never flushed, it becomes a leak.

---

### 4. Detaching DOM But Retaining References

```js
const div = document.getElementById("widget");
document.body.removeChild(div); // detached
window._divRef = div; // now memory can't be freed
```

Detached nodes should be released — or the memory won’t be.

---

### 5. React State or Context Growth

Holding onto large arrays/objects in `useState` or `useContext` long-term can prevent GC.

---

## DevTools Detection

1. Chrome DevTools → Memory → Heap Snapshot
2. Take snapshot → perform action → take another snapshot
3. Compare retained nodes, DOM references, listeners

Use `console.memory`, `performance.memory`, and Chrome’s `Detached DOM` insights.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Gmail

- Keeps massive DOM trees alive for tabs
- Uses internal pool + purge logic

### VSCode Web

- Reuses editors across tabs to reduce memory cost
- Releases hidden views aggressively

### Slack

- Event listener detachment bugs caused multi-GB tabs
- Now aggressively prunes inactive sessions

---

## Best Practices

- Always clean up in `useEffect` return
- Use `AbortController` for fetch cancellation
- Avoid long-lived global state unless necessary
- Use `WeakMap` / `WeakSet` for cache
- Be careful with refs that point to heavy structures

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Forgetting cleanup in `useEffect`
- Global object that holds all fetched data
- Not destroying component instances on route change
- Accumulating children in a `ref` or state without removal

---

## Conclusion: Free What You Don’t Need

Memory leaks are sneaky.

They don’t yell. They don’t throw errors. But they **quietly consume** your app from the inside.

Spot them early. Profile often. Clean up what you create.

Because performance isn’t just about being fast now — it’s about staying fast later.
