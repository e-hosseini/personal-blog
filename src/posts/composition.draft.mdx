# Composition — The Core Principle Behind Flexible UI Components

Composition is the most powerful tool in a component library’s toolbox. It’s what makes UI libraries expressive, extensible, and intuitive. Rather than building rigid, monolithic components, composition allows you to **break behavior and layout into smaller parts**, combine them, and reuse them across contexts.

Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte embrace composition at the core. But to use it well — especially in **reusable design systems** — you need to understand the architectural strategies behind it.

In this long-form guide, we’ll explore:
- Why composition beats configuration
- The role of `children`, `slots`, and `compound components`
- Declarative API design
- Context sharing and coordination
- Real-world composition patterns used by libraries like Radix, Material UI, and Headless UI

---

## What Is Composition in UI?

Composition means combining independent parts to form a cohesive whole.

In UI terms, this means:
- Your components are **made of smaller components**
- You can **replace**, **reorder**, or **omit** those parts
- The parent orchestrates structure — not just behavior

Contrast this with "prop-drilling" configuration:

```tsx
<Modal size="lg" hasFooter={true} footerContent={<CustomFooter />} />
```

vs.

```tsx
<Modal>
  <Modal.Content>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </Modal.Content>
  <Modal.Footer>
    <CustomFooter />
  </Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
```

Composition makes intent **declarative and hierarchical**.

---

## Why Composition Matters

- **Flexibility**: Consumers can opt into or out of structure
- **Readability**: Tree reflects UI layout
- **Separation of concerns**: Each part handles its job
- **Reusability**: Components can be used in new arrangements
- **Slot-like APIs**: Let users inject their own content, not just tweak props

Composition is how you turn components into **a language**, not just widgets.

---

## The Children Prop: Composition 101

React’s `children` prop is the first step in composition:

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader />
  <CardBody>Some text</CardBody>
  <CardFooter />
</Card>
```

Each sub-component might be nothing more than:

```tsx
export const CardHeader = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="card-header">{children}</div>
);
```

Simple, intuitive, and **slot-like** — without needing any extra syntax.

---

## Compound Components

Compound components are a composition pattern where a parent and its children share **context**.

The parent manages state/logic. The children are dumb slots that consume shared context.

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader />
    <AccordionPanel />
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

Internally:

- `Accordion` provides a context
- `AccordionItem` registers itself
- `AccordionHeader` toggles visibility
- `AccordionPanel` shows/hides content

This enables **smart behavior with declarative structure**.

---

## Building Compound Components (React)

```tsx
const AccordionContext = React.createContext();

function Accordion({ children }) {
  const [openIndex, setOpenIndex] = useState(null);
  return (
    <AccordionContext.Provider value={{ openIndex, setOpenIndex }}>
      {children}
    </AccordionContext.Provider>
  );
}

function AccordionItem({ index, children }) {
  return (
    <AccordionContext.Consumer>
      {({ openIndex, setOpenIndex }) => (
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => setOpenIndex(index)}>Toggle</button>
          {openIndex === index && <div>{children}</div>}
        </div>
      )}
    </AccordionContext.Consumer>
  );
}
```

This pattern allows the **consumer to structure layout** while the library provides the behavior.

## Slot Patterns and Interop

In Vue and Web Components, "slots" are first-class. In React, we replicate them using:
- `children`
- `props.children`
- Named children (`props.title`, `props.footer`)
- `cloneElement` or portals

Example:

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger>One</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panel>Content</Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs>
```

This matches mental models from markup and design tools — it’s not just API sugar, it’s a **developer experience enhancer**.

## Real-World Component Systems

### Radix UI

Radix UI embraces compound components fully:
- `<Dialog />`, `<DialogTrigger />`, `<DialogContent />`
- Each part is accessible, styled minimally, and behavior-driven
- Context handles coordination under the hood

### Headless UI (Tailwind)

Composes behavior via component composition + context
- Tabs, Listboxes, Switches all work using slot APIs
- Your UI, their logic

### Material UI

Supports composition via:
- `children`
- `slots` for advanced injection
- `components` prop to replace internal elements

---

## Advanced Patterns

- **Controlled + uncontrolled modes** via context
- **Scoped slots** with context-specific rendering
- **Forward refs across components**
- **Nested composition trees** with modular logic boundaries
- **Render-as** APIs (e.g., `as="a"`) to customize elements

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using composition without isolation — causes style/logic bleed
- Relying only on props to configure deeply nested UIs
- Hiding too much behavior in parent without exposing children
- Failing to document which children are valid (composition is a contract!)
- Overusing `cloneElement` when context would be simpler

---

## Conclusion: Composition Is the API

Composition isn’t a pattern — it’s a philosophy.

It lets your consumers define **structure** while you provide **capability**. It lets you scale complexity without scaling code duplication. And it lets design systems feel like **systems**, not like blocks of settings.

Great component APIs are built with composition at their core.

So don’t just build components.

Compose them.
