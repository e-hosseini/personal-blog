# Filtering and Sorting â€” Building Flexible and Performant APIs

Imagine building a product search for an e-commerce site, a user directory for an enterprise dashboard, or an issue tracker for a DevOps tool. The first thing users expect? The ability to **filter** and **sort** results.

And yet, filtering and sorting logic â€” across APIs â€” is often inconsistent, fragile, or poorly documented.

In this article, weâ€™ll explore filtering and sorting from first principles: why itâ€™s hard, how it evolved, best practices across REST and GraphQL, and how real products like Shopify, GitHub, and Stripe implement it. Weâ€™ll cover syntax design, schema modeling, indexing concerns, and defensive coding â€” to help you build flexible, performant, and developer-friendly APIs.

## Historical Context and Motivation

In early API designs (2000s), REST endpoints were often rigid:

```http
GET /users
GET /users/active
GET /users/recently-created
```

Each filter or sort required a **new route**, increasing surface area and fragmenting logic.

As apps grew more dynamic, API teams needed more **composable, queryable** interfaces â€” without exploding the number of endpoints. This gave rise to:
- Query string parameters in REST (`?filter=name&sort=-createdAt`)
- Structured arguments in GraphQL
- Declarative query objects in Firebase, Firestore, and MongoDB

Today, flexible filtering/sorting is table stakes for modern APIs â€” especially those powering dashboards, analytics, catalogs, feeds, and search.

## REST Filtering Patterns

Thereâ€™s no strict spec for filtering in REST, but common conventions include:

### Basic Key-Value Filters

```http
GET /products?category=shoes&brand=Nike
```

### Range Queries

```http
GET /products?price[gte]=50&price[lte]=100
```

### In/Not In Lists

```http
GET /users?status=in(active,pending)
```

Or:

```http
GET /users?status=active&status=pending
```

### Nested/Relational

```http
GET /orders?customer.name=John&total[gt]=100
```

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use a consistent prefix (`filter[...]`) to avoid param pollution:
```http
GET /products?filter[price][gte]=20&filter[category]=electronics
```

---

## REST Sorting Conventions

Sorting typically looks like:

```http
GET /products?sort=-price,+name
```

Where:
- `-price` means descending
- `+name` (or just `name`) means ascending

ðŸ’¡ You can also support:
- Multiple fields (with fallback)
- Default sorts (e.g., `createdAt DESC`)
- Custom aliases (`relevance`, `popular`, `trending`)

Always document the available fields and directions â€” and reject unsupported fields with clear errors.

---

## GraphQL Filtering and Sorting

In GraphQL, filtering is usually done via structured input types:

```graphql
query {
  products(filter: {
    category: "books",
    price: { gte: 10, lte: 50 }
  }, sort: {
    field: "rating",
    direction: DESC
  }) {
    id
    title
    price
  }
}
```

Many teams define reusable types:

```graphql
input ProductFilter {
  category: String
  brand: String
  price: RangeFilter
  rating: RangeFilter
}

input RangeFilter {
  gte: Float
  lte: Float
}
```

Sorting types:

```graphql
input SortInput {
  field: String
  direction: SortDirection
}

enum SortDirection {
  ASC
  DESC
}
```

## Real-World Examples

### Shopify

Shopify's Storefront API lets you filter collections with GraphQL filters (`first`, `query`, `sortKey`). Their REST admin API uses structured query parameters and supports dozens of filter types.

### Stripe

Stripeâ€™s API supports highly flexible filters for invoices, payments, and customers. Example:

```http
GET /v1/invoices?customer=cus_123&status=paid&created[gte]=1680000000
```

Internally, Stripe parses and validates every filter parameter against a known schema â€” making their API robust and secure.

### GitHub

GitHubâ€™s GraphQL API enables compound filters on issues, pull requests, repos, and users â€” using full type-safe query definitions and powerful `filter` objects.

## Backend Schema Design

When designing filters, consider:

- Which fields are safe and performant to filter on?
- Can you expose raw DB columns? Or should you alias them?
- Do filters map directly to SQL clauses? Or require transformation?

**Example: SQL-safe filter parser (PostgreSQL)**

```sql
WHERE
  category = $1 AND
  price >= $2 AND
  price <= $3
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT $4 OFFSET $5
```

Indexing is key. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to test the performance of filtered queries â€” especially when combining filters with sorts.

---

## Frontend Considerations

- Always show **active filters** to the user
- Allow filters to be changed without full reload (React Query, SWR, Apollo)
- Store filters in query string or global state (Zustand, Redux)
- Use dropdowns, pills, chips, toggles â€” but preserve **semantic URL state**
- Disable sort options when fields aren't available (e.g. canâ€™t sort by `price` if no price filter active)

---

## Testing and Validation

- Test for bad filters (`sort=abcxyz`)
- Validate data types (`gte=abc`)
- Enforce filter whitelisting to prevent injection
- Write integration tests with deep combinations (status + date + price + search)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Mixing filters and unrelated query params (`&debug=true&filter=name`)
- Exposing raw SQL columns or data model fields
- Allowing unlimited unindexed fields in filters
- Making sort fields behave inconsistently (`name` sorts a string, but `price` fails)

---

## Conclusion: Filters Are APIs, Not Just UX

Filtering and sorting arenâ€™t optional â€” theyâ€™re **core parts of your API contract**. They shape the performance of every query, the experience of every user, and the safety of your backend under load.

Design them deliberately:
- Type your filters
- Document everything
- Validate aggressively
- And always benchmark the impact

Good filters empower developers. Great filters scale the product.

Build both.
