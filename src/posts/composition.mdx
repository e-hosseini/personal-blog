# Composition — The Fundamental Paradigm of Robust UI Components

Component composition is the linchpin of a component library's arsenal, furnishing UI libraries with expressiveness, extensibility, and intuitiveness. Composition, unlike the construction of rigid, monolithic components, facilitates breaking down behavior and layout into manageable parts which can be combined and reused across different contexts.

Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte have composition at their heart. However, to leverage it effectively, particularly in reusable design systems, it's critical to comprehend the underlying architectural strategies.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore:
- The advantage of composition over configuration
- The functions of `children`, `slots`, and `compound components`
- Declarative API design
- Sharing and coordination of context
- Real-world composition patterns used by libraries like Radix, Material UI, and Headless UI

## Understanding Composition in UI

In the context of UI, composition embodies the idea of combining independent parts to create a cohesive whole. More specifically, this implies:
- Your components are constructed using **smaller components**
- These smaller parts can be **replaced**, **rearranged**, or **excluded**
- The parent component orchestrates the structure, not merely the behavior

Contrast this with a configuration-based approach, often referred to as "prop-drilling":

```tsx
<Modal size="lg" hasFooter={true} footerContent={<CustomFooter />} />
```

vs.

```tsx
<Modal>
  <Modal.Content>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </Modal.Content>
  <Modal.Footer>
    <CustomFooter />
  </Modal.Footer>
</Modal>
```

In composition, the intent is made **declarative and hierarchical**.

---

## The Relevance of Composition

Component composition offers several advantages:
- **Flexibility**: Consumers can choose to include or exclude structure
- **Readability**: The tree-like structure mirrors the UI layout
- **Separation of concerns**: Each part performs its specific task
- **Reusability**: Components can be rearranged and used in new contexts
- **Slot-like APIs**: Users can inject their own content instead of merely tweaking props

Composition thus transforms components into **a language**, rather than just widgets.

---

## The Children Prop: Composition 101

React’s `children` prop is the first step in composition:

```tsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader />
  <CardBody>Some text</CardBody>
  <CardFooter />
</Card>
```

Each sub-component might be as simple as:

```tsx
export const CardHeader = ({ children }) => (
  <div className="card-header">{children}</div>
);
```

This approach is simple, intuitive, and offers a **slot-like** mechanism without requiring any additional syntax.

---

## Compound Components

Compound components are a composition pattern where a parent and its children share a common **context**.

In this pattern, the parent component manages state and logic. In contrast, the child components act as dumb slots that consume the shared context.

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem>
    <AccordionHeader />
    <AccordionPanel />
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

On a closer look:
- `Accordion` provides a context
- `AccordionItem` registers itself
- `AccordionHeader` toggles visibility
- `AccordionPanel` reveals or hides content

This pattern enables **intelligent behavior with a declarative structure**.

---

## Building Compound Components (React)

Let's look at an example of how to build compound components using React:

```tsx
const AccordionContext = React.createContext();

function Accordion({ children }) {
  const [openIndex, setOpenIndex] = useState(null);
  return (
    <AccordionContext.Provider value={{ openIndex, setOpenIndex }}>
      {children}
    </AccordionContext.Provider>
  );
}

function AccordionItem({ index, children }) {
  return (
    <AccordionContext.Consumer>
      {({ openIndex, setOpenIndex }) => (
        <div>
          <button onClick={() => setOpenIndex(index)}>Toggle</button>
          {openIndex === index && <div>{children}</div>}
        </div>
      )}
    </AccordionContext.Consumer>
  );
}
```

This pattern empowers the **consumer to structure the layout** while the library provides the behavior.

## Slot Patterns and Interoperability

In Vue and Web Components, "slots" are first-class citizens. In React, we emulate them using:
- `children`
- `props.children`
- Named children (`props.title`, `props.footer`)
- `cloneElement` or portals

Here is an example:

```tsx
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List>
    <Tabs.Trigger>One</Tabs.Trigger>
  </Tabs.List>
  <Tabs.Panel>Content</Tabs.Panel>
</Tabs>
```

This approach aligns with mental models from markup and design tools. It's not merely a syntactic sugar, but a **developer experience enhancer**.

## Real-World Component Systems

### Radix UI

Radix UI fully embraces the concept of compound components:
- `<Dialog />`, `<DialogTrigger />`, `<DialogContent />`
- Each part is accessible, minimally styled, and behavior-driven
- Context handles coordination under the hood

### Headless UI (Tailwind)

Tailwind's Headless UI composes behavior via component composition and context
- Tabs, Listboxes, Switches all work using slot APIs
- Your UI, their logic

### Material UI

Material UI supports composition via:
- `children`
- `slots` for advanced injection
- `components` prop to replace internal elements

---

## Advanced Patterns

- **Controlled + uncontrolled modes** via context
- **Scoped slots** with context-specific rendering
- **Forwarding references across components**
- **Nested composition trees** with modular logic boundaries
- **Render-as** APIs (e.g., `as="a"`) to customize elements

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using composition without isolation which leads to style/logic bleed
- Relying solely on props to configure deeply nested UIs
- Hiding too much behavior in parent components without exposing children
- Neglecting to document which children are valid (composition is a contract!)
- Overusing `cloneElement` when context would be simpler

---

## Conclusion: Composition Is the API

Composition is not merely a pattern — it's a philosophy.

It empowers your consumers to define **structure** while you provide the **capability**. It allows you to manage complexity without escalating code duplication. And it makes design systems feel like cohesive **systems**, not just blocks of settings.

Great component APIs are built with composition at their core.

Therefore, don't just build components.

Compose them.
