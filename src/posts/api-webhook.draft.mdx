# Webhooks â€” Real-Time Communication Without Polling

Most APIs are **request-driven** â€” the client asks, and the server answers. But what if the client doesnâ€™t know when to ask?

Thatâ€™s where **webhooks** come in.

Webhooks reverse the flow. Instead of the client polling every few seconds, the server proactively **pushes updates** to the client when an event happens â€” new order, user signup, payment completed, repo pushed, and more.

Theyâ€™re essential for building connected systems, enabling integrations, and delivering **real-time UX** without infrastructure bloat.

---

## The Problem Webhooks Solve

Imagine a user updates their billing info in Stripe.

Without webhooks, your app must:
- Periodically poll Stripe for changes
- Waste resources checking when nothing changed
- Miss updates in between polling intervals

With webhooks:
- Stripe sends you a `customer.updated` event instantly
- You process it immediately
- The userâ€™s profile reflects the update in real-time

Webhooks are how systems **notify each other**, just-in-time.

---

## Core Webhook Concepts

- **Event**: Something that happened (`user.created`, `order.shipped`)
- **Receiver (consumer)**: Your server that receives the event
- **Payload**: JSON body with data about the event
- **Signature**: A cryptographic hash to verify authenticity
- **Retry logic**: In case the receiver is down or slow

Webhooks typically use:
- HTTP POST
- JSON payloads
- Retries with exponential backoff
- Authentication headers or HMAC signatures

---

## Example Webhook Payload

```http
POST /webhooks/stripe HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Stripe-Signature: t=12345,v1=abc,v2=...

{
  "type": "invoice.paid",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "in_123",
      "amount_paid": 4200
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Design Patterns for Webhooks

- Use **dedicated webhook routes** (`/webhooks/stripe`, `/hooks/github`)
- Respond quickly (under 1s) to avoid timeouts
- Queue long-running logic (e.g. with Redis, SQS, or background workers)
- Log every payload and status for observability
- Use **idempotency** â€” donâ€™t double-process

ðŸ’¡ Always return **2xx** to confirm delivery. Retry logic depends on this.

---

## Securing Webhooks

- âœ… Validate HMAC signatures (e.g. SHA256 with secret key)
- âœ… Check the `User-Agent` or custom headers
- âœ… Enforce IP allowlists (for critical systems)
- âœ… Reject unexpected payload shapes or events

Example: Stripe HMAC verification (Node.js)

```ts
const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
  req.body,
  req.headers['stripe-signature'],
  STRIPE_SECRET
);
```

Never trust unauthenticated incoming HTTP requests without validation.

---

## Retry Logic and Reliability

Webhook systems must assume:
- The consumer may be down
- Timeouts will happen
- Delivery is not guaranteed without retries

Use **exponential backoff**, retry for at least 24â€“72 hours, and log failures with:
- Status code
- Time received
- Body
- Headers

Some platforms include dashboards to inspect and resend (e.g. Stripe, GitHub, Slack).

---

## Webhook Consumers: Best Practices

- Respond with `2xx` only after success
- Use unique IDs for deduplication
- Write tests for idempotency
- Monitor webhook delivery rate and latency
- Store `event_id` or payload hash for traceability

---

## Real-World Examples

### Stripe

- Fires dozens of event types (`payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.failed`)
- Uses HMAC signatures + secret keys
- Provides retries and a webhook dashboard with resends

### GitHub

- Sends push events, pull request events, deployment hooks
- Supports secret token signing
- Allows delivery tracing per event

### Slack

- Uses incoming/outgoing webhooks for custom integrations
- Provides test tool and retry simulation
- Payloads include timestamps, user metadata, and message content

---

## Debugging Webhooks

Use tools like:
- [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site)
- [RequestBin](https://requestbin.com)
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com)
- [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

Log **everything** in staging and production:
- Timestamps
- Headers
- Event types
- Request/response bodies
- Retry counts

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Blocking your app on webhook success
- Not validating sender identity
- Assuming once-only delivery
- Ignoring failed retries
- Letting 3rd-party webhook failures break internal workflows

---

## Conclusion: Webhooks Are APIs in Reverse

Webhooks make your systems smarter. They remove guesswork, reduce load, and unlock powerful integrations across platforms and teams.

They arenâ€™t an afterthought â€” theyâ€™re a core part of modern architecture.

Design them with the same care you give to endpoints:
- Secure them
- Log them
- Make them resilient
- And most of all â€” **make them useful**.

APIs are how we ask.

Webhooks are how we listen.
