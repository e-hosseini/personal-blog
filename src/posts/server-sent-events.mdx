# Server-Sent Events (SSE) — One-Way Push, Simplified

In the universe of real-time communication, **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** often go under the radar. But for many use cases, they’re the **perfect fit**: lightweight, reliable, HTTP-native, and ideal for sending a continuous stream of updates from the server to the browser.

Unlike WebSockets, which are bidirectional, SSE is a **one-way push mechanism** over HTTP. The server streams events to the client — think: notifications, logs, dashboards, live counters, or telemetry — using a persistent connection and a simple event protocol.

SSE combines the best of both worlds: real-time feel, with all the simplicity of HTTP.

---

## What is SSE?

SSE is built into the browser via the `EventSource` API. It’s a native feature of HTML5, meaning no polyfills, no custom protocols, and no weird client SDKs.

```js
const source = new EventSource("/api/stream");

source.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log("New message:", event.data);
};
```

The server keeps the connection open and **streams text-based events** formatted like:

```http
data: {"message": "Hello, world!"}



```

Each event can include:
- `event:` custom event name
- `id:` identifier for reconnection
- `retry:` reconnect delay (ms)

---

## Why Use SSE?

SSE is great when:
- You need **real-time delivery** from server to browser
- Only the server sends data (e.g., alerts, counters)
- You want **built-in reconnect** and **auto handling**
- You need HTTP/1.1 compatibility (no custom upgrade)

Compared to WebSockets:
- Easier to set up
- Works over HTTP/2
- Plays well with proxies, firewalls, load balancers

---

## Example: Basic SSE Server (Node.js)

```js
app.get("/api/stream", (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/event-stream");
  res.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache");
  res.setHeader("Connection", "keep-alive");

  setInterval(() => {
    res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify({ timestamp: Date.now() })}\n\n`);
  }, 1000);
});
```

The connection stays open — and the browser keeps receiving `onmessage` events every second.

---

## Use Cases for SSE

### Notifications

Push real-time notifications to the UI without polling. SSE ensures that messages are delivered as soon as they’re emitted.

### Live Counters / Dashboards

Ideal for metrics, analytics, and dashboards that update frequently — SSE provides continuous streams with no overhead.

### CI/CD Logs

Streaming logs from a build pipeline or deployment job is trivial with SSE. Events arrive as soon as they’re flushed server-side.

## Comparison: SSE vs WebSockets

| Feature               | SSE               | WebSocket           |
|------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Direction              | Server → Client   | Bi-directional       |
| Browser support        | Native (EventSource) | Native + JS API    |
| Transport              | HTTP              | Custom protocol      |
| Reconnects             | Auto              | Manual               |
| Simplicity             | ✅ Easy            | ⚠️ More complex       |
| Proxies/CDN friendly   | ✅ Yes             | ⚠️ Can break          |
| Use case               | Notifications, logs | Chats, games         |

---

## Limitations of SSE

- **One-way only**: you can’t send data from client to server over the same channel
- **Not supported in IE or some older browsers**
- **Not ideal for binary data** (text only)
- Some CDNs and proxies might buffer output unless `X-Accel-Buffering` or `flush()` is used

---

## Reconnection and Reliability

SSE has built-in recovery logic:
- Clients auto-reconnect on disconnect
- You can use `id:` to mark the last message
- Server receives `Last-Event-ID` header to resume stream

```http
id: 172456
data: {"message": "Hello again"}
```

Use this for:
- Recovering from disconnection
- Resuming missed messages
- Implementing "at-least-once" delivery guarantees

---

## Real-World Usage

### Netlify / Vercel

Uses SSE to stream logs and deployment events to developer dashboards.

### GitHub Actions

SSE (or WebSockets depending on browser) used to stream CI logs live to job viewer.

### Firebase Emulator

Uses SSE for local data streaming in the dev console, making mock data updates visible instantly.

---

## Server Considerations

- Set `Content-Type: text/event-stream`
- Flush headers immediately
- Disable buffering on reverse proxies (e.g., `X-Accel-Buffering: no`)
- Stream heartbeats every 20–30s to avoid idle timeout

Example in Express:

```js
res.write(":

"); // heartbeat
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using SSE for high-throughput chat (use WebSocket)
- Forgetting to reconnect manually in legacy fallback
- Not closing connections on client inactivity
- Streaming huge payloads (SSE is better for small messages)

---

## Conclusion: Simplicity That Streams

SSE is the **cleanest, lowest-friction** way to push real-time data from server to client — no upgrades, no custom headers, just plain HTTP.

It won’t replace WebSockets for everything. But for notifications, metrics, logs, and single-direction updates, it’s a brilliant tool.

Don’t overengineer real-time.

Sometimes, a stream of text is all you need.
