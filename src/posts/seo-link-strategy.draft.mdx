# SEO Link Strategy — Internal, External & Canonical Linking

Search engines don’t just crawl — they **navigate**.

And the way you link your content determines:
- How well it’s indexed
- How link equity flows
- How easy your site is to explore

In this guide, we’ll break down:
- Internal linking strategy
- External links and outbound trust
- Canonical URLs
- Link text, navigation, and crawl depth

Done right, good linking boosts SEO **more than almost anything else**.

---

## 1. Internal Linking

Internal links are links that point to other pages on the same site.

### Why they matter:
- Help crawlers find and index all your pages
- Pass link equity (aka PageRank)
- Create topic clusters and semantic relevance
- Keep users engaged and reduce bounce rate

### Best Practices

- Use **descriptive anchor text**
- Link from high-traffic pages to low-visibility content
- Add links **in context**, not just nav/footers
- Use keyword-rich phrases naturally

---

## 2. External Links

### What they do:
- Build trust and authority
- Help users find source/reference material
- Improve SEO when linking to quality sites

### Best Practices

- Link to **relevant, authoritative** sources
- Avoid link farms or shady domains
- Use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security on target="_blank"
- Don’t be afraid to link out — Google expects it

---

## 3. Canonical URLs

Canonical links prevent **duplicate content issues**.

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/article-slug" />
```

Used to:
- Tell search engines which version is “real”
- Consolidate link equity
- Avoid duplicate penalties from query params or similar pages

### When to use

- Pagination
- Tracking URLs
- Translations / content variations
- Syndicated content

---

## Link Text Matters

Bad:

```html
<a href="/blog/123">Click here</a>
```

Good:

```html
<a href="/blog/123">Understanding Web Performance Bottlenecks</a>
```

Use context-rich, meaningful anchors. Helps both SEO and screen readers.

---

## Crawling & Depth

Pages more than **3 clicks deep** from the homepage may get ignored.

Use sitemaps, breadcrumbs, and consistent navigation paths.

---

## Real-World Examples

### Wikipedia

- Master of internal links
- Every concept links to a dedicated article
- Dense, structured, highly crawlable

### MDN Web Docs

- Every spec, property, and method cross-linked
- Forms a semantic network of pages

### Shopify

- Canonicals used across paginated product listings
- Cross-linking between product collections

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using “read more” or “click here” for every link
- Linking the same page 10x with identical anchor
- Canonical tags pointing to broken or unrelated pages
- Only linking via sidebars or auto-generated nav

---

## Conclusion: Link Like a Librarian

Your website is a library — and links are the shelves, signs, and pathways that make it navigable.

Link with intent.

Link with context.

And build a structure that’s not just crawlable — but **navigable, trustworthy, and semantically rich**.
