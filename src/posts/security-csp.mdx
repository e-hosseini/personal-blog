# CSP — Content Security Policy for Runtime Defense

You’ve written clean code. You’ve escaped output. You’ve sanitized input.

But what happens if something **still gets through**?

That’s what **Content Security Policy (CSP)** is for — a powerful browser-based firewall that mitigates:
- XSS attacks
- Script injections
- Malicious third-party assets

CSP doesn’t just prevent execution — it gives you **visibility** and **control** over what can run on your page.

---

## What is CSP?

CSP is an HTTP header (or meta tag) that tells the browser:
> Only load and execute resources from these allowed sources.

It works like a **whitelist** for:
- Scripts
- Styles
- Images
- Fonts
- Frames
- Connections

When used correctly, it shuts down many classes of attacks **before they do harm**.

---

## Basic CSP Example

```http
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' https://trusted.cdn.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  object-src 'none';
```

This means:
- Only load scripts from current origin and trusted CDN
- Allow inline styles (not recommended unless necessary)
- Block all `<object>` and Flash embeds

---

## Key Directives

| Directive       | Purpose                                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `default-src`   | Fallback for all other resource types           |
| `script-src`    | JavaScript files and inline scripts             |
| `style-src`     | CSS and style tags                              |
| `img-src`       | Images and favicons                             |
| `font-src`      | Font files                                      |
| `connect-src`   | XHR, fetch, WebSocket endpoints                 |
| `frame-src`     | `<iframe>` sources                              |
| `object-src`    | Flash, plugins (usually set to `'none'`)        |
| `report-uri`    | Where violations are reported                   |

---

## Preventing Inline Scripts

XSS attacks often rely on injecting `<script>` or event handlers (`onclick="..."`).

Disable inline scripts with:

```http
script-src 'self';
```

Or, allow only **hashes** or **nonces**:

```html
<script nonce="abc123">/* your script */</script>
```

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-abc123';
```

---

## Violation Reporting

Use `report-uri` or `report-to` to gather metrics:

```http
Content-Security-Policy:
  default-src 'self';
  report-uri https://csp.example.com/report;
```

Browsers send JSON reports when violations occur. Helps detect:
- Attacks
- Misconfigurations
- Third-party issues

---

## Real-World Example: GitHub

GitHub sets strict CSP:

- `object-src 'none'`
- `base-uri 'none'`
- `script-src` with nonce + hash whitelisting
- Dynamic headers updated on each page render

This protects against repo injection, malicious gists, etc.

---

## Using CSP in Your App

### Express.js Example

```js
const helmet = require("helmet");
app.use(helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
  directives: {
    defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
    scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://cdn.example.com"],
    objectSrc: ["'none'"],
  },
}));
```

### Meta Tag (not recommended for strict enforcement)

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self';" />
```

## Tools to Build and Test CSP

- [CSP Evaluator by Google](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/)
- [Report URI](https://report-uri.com/)
- Chrome DevTools → Security panel
- Mozilla Observatory

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting `connect-src` for fetch/AJAX
- Allowing `'unsafe-inline'` without need
- Not updating hash/nonce when scripts change
- CSP only via meta (doesn’t protect early content)

---

## Progressive Rollout Strategy

1. Start with `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`
2. Log violations and tune policy
3. Once stable, switch to enforcing `Content-Security-Policy`

---

## Conclusion: CSP Buys You Time

No site is 100% immune to injection — but CSP makes exploitation **much harder**.

It buys you time.

It warns you early.

And in many cases, it **stops the attack cold**.

Make CSP a part of your security baseline — just like HTTPS, escaping, and linting.

Because defense in depth isn’t optional — it’s essential.
