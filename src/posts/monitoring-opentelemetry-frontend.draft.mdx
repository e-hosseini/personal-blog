# Frontend Observability with OpenTelemetry — Tracing Beyond the Backend

When you think OpenTelemetry, you probably think: backend, APIs, Go, Java, and spans between microservices.

But what if you could:
- Trace a **user click**
- Capture when an API call was made
- Follow that call across services
- And **connect it back to the frontend interaction that triggered it**

That’s what **frontend observability with OpenTelemetry** unlocks — and it's the **future of full-stack tracing**.

---

## What is OpenTelemetry?

**OpenTelemetry (OTel)** is an open-source observability framework that provides:
- Unified APIs for generating **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**
- Context propagation across systems
- Vendor-neutral instrumentation
- Support for JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more

OTel is governed by CNCF and supported by vendors like:
- Datadog
- New Relic
- Honeycomb
- Lightstep
- Grafana

It’s not tied to any APM tool. It’s the **plumbing layer** for telemetry.

---

## Why Frontend + OpenTelemetry?

Traditionally, frontend errors and performance live in tools like Sentry or LogRocket.

Backend spans and metrics go to tools like Datadog or Prometheus.

But what if:
- Clicking “Submit Order” starts a trace
- That trace continues through your API
- Into your backend, DB, and even external services
- And returns with a unified view of the **entire user journey**

You gain:
- Unified trace IDs across browser and server
- Full-stack root cause analysis
- Performance bottleneck correlation
- User-centric diagnostics

---

## Basic Architecture

```
Browser (React, Vue, etc.)
  ↳ Instrumented via OTel JS SDK
  ↳ Generates spans for navigation, user actions, API calls
    ↳ Adds `traceparent` header to outbound fetch/XHR
      ↳ Backend receives trace context
        ↳ Backend continues trace with OpenTelemetry SDK
          ↳ Entire span chain visualized in backend APM
```

---

## Core Concepts in OpenTelemetry

- **Trace**: A tree of spans representing a request lifecycle
- **Span**: A single unit of work (e.g., “GET /api/orders”)
- **Context**: Metadata like trace ID, parent span ID, service name
- **Exporter**: Where data is sent (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin, Datadog)

---

## Setting Up Frontend OTel (JavaScript/React)

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web   @opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch   @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http
```

### Configure tracing:

```js
import { WebTracerProvider } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-web';
import { FetchInstrumentation } from '@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fetch';
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http';

const provider = new WebTracerProvider();

provider.addSpanProcessor(new SimpleSpanProcessor(
  new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: 'https://your-observability-platform/v1/traces'
  })
));

provider.register();

// Add instrumentation
new FetchInstrumentation({
  propagateTraceHeaderCorsUrls: [/your-api.com/],
});
```

This sets up:
- Automatic tracing of all `fetch()` calls
- Propagation of `traceparent` headers
- Export of spans to backend collector

---

## Creating Custom Spans

```js
const tracer = provider.getTracer('my-frontend-app');

const span = tracer.startSpan('user-clicked-login-button');
// business logic
span.end();
```

Use to trace:
- UI interactions
- State transitions
- Route changes
- Component rendering

---

## Correlating with Backend

Backend must:
- Use the same OTel trace headers (`traceparent`, `tracestate`)
- Accept incoming context and link it to its spans

This allows visualization tools (e.g., Jaeger, Honeycomb) to show:
```
User Click → API Request → Auth Service → DB Query
```

All connected by a single trace ID.

---

## Real-World Example: Vercel + OTel

- Frontend spans track hydration and route transitions
- OTel hooks into middleware, functions, edge handlers
- Unified traces sent to third-party backend (e.g., Datadog)

### Another: Netflix

- Custom spans from React apps
- Fetch spans link to backend microservices
- Combined with logs and metrics for SLA tracking

---

## Exporting to Your Observability Platform

Supported exporters:
- **OTLP/HTTP** (standard, supported by most vendors)
- **Console** (for local dev)
- **Jaeger**, **Zipkin**
- Vendor SDKs (Datadog, Lightstep, Honeycomb, etc.)

---

## Best Practices

- Name spans clearly (e.g., `user_interaction:search`, `api_call:/products`)
- Add meaningful attributes (`userId`, `page`, `deviceType`)
- Use `traceparent` consistently
- Avoid noise (too many low-value spans)
- Combine with RUM and Web Vitals

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Tracing only on backend — you miss UX context
- Frontend spans without correlation IDs
- Overhead-heavy tracing in tight loops
- Logging spans instead of exporting

---

## Conclusion: Make the Invisible Visible

Your users don’t see microservices. They see laggy buttons, spinning spinners, and slow screens.

OpenTelemetry brings backend-grade observability to the frontend:
- Trace user actions
- Connect UI to API
- Measure what happens **across the stack**

It’s the glue between DevX and UX — and the future of **full-stack debugging**.
