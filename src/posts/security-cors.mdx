# In-depth Analysis and Understanding of CORS — Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

In the course of developing modern web applications, it's common for systems to communicate across different domains. Take, for instance, a scenario where your frontend application is hosted at `app.com` and it interacts with a backend API residing at `api.com`.

The browser perceives these as two distinct **origins** and for the sake of security, implements a stringent rule:
> JavaScript is denied from making cross-origin requests unless the server permits it explicitly.

This security mechanism is known as **CORS** — Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## The Underlying Principle of CORS

The primary purpose of CORS is to safeguard users from potential threats that might arise from malicious websites intending to:
- Extract sensitive data from other origins
- Make API calls using the user's authentication
- Exploit Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks through XHR or fetch

In the absence of CORS, **any web page could potentially call any API** and read the response using the user’s credentials, leading to serious security breaches.

## Defining “Cross-Origin”

In the context of web security, an origin is demarcated by the combination of **scheme (protocol) + domain + port**.

For example:
- `https://api.example.com` ≠ `https://example.com`
- `http://localhost:3000` ≠ `http://localhost:5000`
- `https://example.com` ≠ `http://example.com`

Hence, even the same domain with a different protocol or port is considered **cross-origin**.

## CORS Explained Through Code

### Simple Request

Consider the following JavaScript fetch request:

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
```

The browser performs a series of checks:
- It verifies if the method is `GET`, `POST`, or `HEAD`.
- It checks if the headers are simple (i.e., it does not contain any custom headers).
- It examines if the response is permitted via the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

If the checks pass and the server allows the request, the server responds with the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.example.com
```

## Preflight Requests in CORS

In scenarios where a request:
- Utilizes methods such as `PUT`, `DELETE`
- Sends custom headers
- Possesses a content type like `application/json`

The browser sends a **preflight** request, which is an HTTP OPTIONS request, to the server:

```http
OPTIONS /data HTTP/1.1
Origin: https://frontend.example.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type
```

The server must respond with appropriate `Access-Control-*` headers:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type
```

## Allowing Credentials in CORS

To allow cookies to be sent with the request, the server must include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

And the frontend must explicitly enable credentials in the fetch request:

```js
fetch(url, { credentials: "include" });
```

Note: When using credentials, `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` **cannot** be `*`.

## Common Misconfigurations in CORS

- Setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` while also using cookies. This is a security risk as it allows any origin to read the response.
- Neglecting to respond to `OPTIONS` requests. This will cause preflighted requests to fail.
- Dynamically allowing origins **without validation** (e.g., `res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin)`). This could allow malicious sites to bypass the CORS policy.
- Not setting `Vary: Origin` which can break caching because it tells the browser to cache different CORS responses for different origins.

## Configuring CORS: Application Examples

### Express.js (Node)

In an Express.js application, you can use the `cors` middleware to enable CORS:

```js
const cors = require("cors");
app.use(cors({
  origin: "https://frontend.example.com",
  credentials: true
}));
```

### NGINX

In an NGINX server configuration, you can use the `add_header` directive:

```nginx
location /api/ {
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin https://frontend.example.com;
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials true;
}
```

## Real-World Example: Stripe

Stripe’s API only allows CORS for:
- Public `fetch()` APIs (e.g., Elements, webhooks)
- Origins that are part of Stripe’s official frontend products

Requests from arbitrary websites to `https://api.stripe.com` are **blocked** unless explicitly allowed.

## Tools for Debugging CORS Issues

- Chrome DevTools → Network → XHR → Headers/Console can be used to inspect the request and response headers.
- CORS Anywhere can be used for testing with proxies, by making requests through a server that adds the necessary CORS headers.
- Postman doesn't enforce the CORS policy and can be used to make requests directly to the server.
- curl can simulate different request headers and methods.

## Anti-Patterns in CORS

- Allowing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on authenticated endpoints. This is a security risk as it allows any origin to read the response.
- Ignoring preflight headers. This can lead to unexpected behavior as the server may not be prepared to handle the actual request.
- Not responding to OPTIONS with correct CORS headers. This will cause preflighted requests to fail.
- Not logging failed origin checks. This can help in troubleshooting and identifying potential security breaches.

## Conclusion: Trust, but Verify

CORS is akin to the browser’s built-in firewall. It aims to prevent unauthorized data leaks, token theft, and abuse of credentials.

As a frontend developer:
- Be aware of what your API server expects in terms of CORS.
- Understand what triggers a preflight request.
- Test every fetch request, not just in your development environment.

And as a backend developer:
- Whitelist only trusted origins.
- Treat CORS as a security boundary — because it indeed is.
