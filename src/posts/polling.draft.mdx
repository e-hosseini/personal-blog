# Polling — Keeping UIs in Sync with Server State

Polling is one of the oldest and simplest ways to keep the frontend in sync with the backend — but it's also one of the most misunderstood.

At its core, polling means **repeatedly requesting data** from the server at a fixed interval. It’s how you ask, “Has anything changed?” over and over — hoping for a new answer.

While more sophisticated techniques like Server-Sent Events and WebSockets offer real-time capabilities, polling remains relevant in many apps due to its **reliability, compatibility, and ease of use**.

In this article, we’ll explore:
- What polling is and why it matters
- How to implement it correctly in modern apps
- Short polling vs long polling
- Performance considerations and best practices
- Real-world polling strategies from top products

## What Is Polling?

Polling is a network strategy where the client:
1. Sends a request to the server
2. Receives a response (new or unchanged)
3. Waits (or not), then repeats

There are two broad types:
- **Short polling**: Fires every X seconds (e.g. `setInterval`)
- **Long polling**: Keeps the connection open until something changes

Short polling is like repeatedly asking: “Are we there yet?”
Long polling is like saying: “Tell me when we’re there.”

## Implementing Short Polling

Simple version:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    fetch("/api/status")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(console.log);
  }, 5000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

Short polling is:
- ✅ Simple
- ✅ Works everywhere
- ❌ Wastes bandwidth if nothing changes
- ❌ Can overload APIs under heavy traffic

---

## Implementing Long Polling

```tsx
function poll() {
  fetch("/api/updates")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      updateUI(data);
      poll(); // restart immediately
    });
}

useEffect(() => {
  poll();
}, []);
```

Long polling:
- ✅ Reduces unnecessary requests
- ✅ Faster data delivery
- ❌ Harder to debug
- ❌ Needs timeout handling and error recovery

## Real-World Use Cases

### Slack

- Uses WebSockets when possible
- Falls back to polling if sockets are blocked by firewalls

### GitHub Notifications

- Short polling every 60–120 seconds to check for new alerts
- Adjusts interval based on activity

### CI/CD Tools (e.g. Netlify, Vercel)

- Poll build/deploy logs using short polling or long polling with ETag diffing
- Render logs incrementally as they arrive

---

## Best Practices

- Use **exponential backoff** on failures
- Use **ETag** or `Last-Modified` headers to avoid re-downloading unchanged data
- Pause polling when tab is hidden (`visibilitychange`)
- Don't poll from multiple tabs — coordinate with `BroadcastChannel`
- Debounce pollers on param changes (e.g., filtered views)

---

## Optimization Strategies

- Use `AbortController` to cancel in-flight requests if user navigates away
- Avoid polling resources that are unlikely to change (e.g., metadata)
- Use conditional headers to reduce payload size
- Switch to push-based when practical (SSE/WebSocket)

---

## Polling in React Query / SWR

```tsx
useQuery("data", fetcher, { refetchInterval: 5000 });
```

- Automatically re-polls on interval
- Stops polling when component unmounts
- Refetches on focus/tab switch

SWR:

```tsx
useSWR("/api/data", fetcher, { refreshInterval: 5000 });
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Hardcoding `setInterval` in global scope
- Polling with `fetch` but ignoring stale responses
- Triggering full data reloads on every poll
- Failing to pause polling during errors or when user is idle
- Ignoring retry strategy — leading to thundering herd problem

---

## When Not to Use Polling

- Ultra-low latency applications (use WebSockets)
- Broadcast-based updates (prefer SSE or pub/sub)
- High-traffic scenarios with expensive data

Polling is reliable, but **not always scalable**. Use it when:
- You have few users
- Data changes slowly
- You can cache between polls

---

## Conclusion: Polling Done Right Is Still Powerful

Polling gets a bad rap. But with the right strategy — caching, debouncing, pausing, headers, and smart intervals — it becomes a surprisingly robust and practical solution for many frontend apps.

Don’t over-engineer real-time when polling fits the job.

And when you outgrow it? Level up to push.

Until then: keep asking the server nicely, at the right times.
