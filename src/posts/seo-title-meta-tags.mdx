## SEO Essentials — `<title>` and `<meta>` Tags That Matter

The `<head>` of your HTML page might not look exciting — but it’s where **SEO begins**.

Two of the most powerful and overlooked tools in SEO are:
- The `<title>` tag
- The `<meta>` description

These aren't just for search engines — they’re for **humans scanning the search results**, deciding whether or not to click your link.

In this guide, we’ll cover:
- The purpose and behavior of `<title>` and `<meta>`
- Best practices for writing them
- Real-world examples and common mistakes
- Dynamic rendering for SPAs
- How these tags affect SEO and UX

---

## The `<title>` Tag

### What It Does

- Displays in browser tabs and bookmarks
- Used as the **main link** in Google search results
- Influences relevance, rankings, and click-through rate

### Best Practices

- Keep under **60 characters**
- Use **target keywords early**
- Make it unique per page
- Describe the content — don't just repeat your brand

### Example

```html
<title>Web Accessibility Guide — Build Inclusive Interfaces | MyApp</title>
```

Bad:

```html
<title>Home</title>
```

---

## The `<meta name="description">` Tag

### What It Does

- Provides a **summary** of the page
- Used as the snippet below the title in search engines
- Does **not** affect ranking directly, but affects **CTR** (click-through rate)

### Best Practices

- Under **160 characters**
- Describe the value of the page
- Include relevant keywords naturally
- Avoid keyword stuffing or vague text

### Example

```html
<meta name="description" content="A complete guide to web accessibility, including ARIA, color contrast, screen readers, and keyboard support.">
```

## Dynamic SPAs & Meta Tags

In React, Vue, etc., you can use libraries to manage metadata dynamically:

### React Helmet

```tsx
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet";

<Helmet>
  <title>Contact Us | MyApp</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Reach out to our support and sales teams." />
</Helmet>
```

### Next.js

```tsx
import Head from "next/head";

<Head>
  <title>About | MyApp</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Learn about our mission and team." />
</Head>
```

---

## Open Graph and Social Meta Tags

These tags help platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn display **rich previews**:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Web Accessibility Guide" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Build inclusive interfaces with this complete accessibility reference." />
<meta property="og:image" content="/social-preview.png" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
```

These don’t affect SEO rankings, but **drive more shares and clicks**.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Using the same title/meta on every page
- Leaving tags blank or unconfigured
- Putting entire articles in meta descriptions
- Stuffing keywords unnaturally
- Relying on JS without server-side rendering fallback

---

## Tools to Audit Tags

- Google Search Console → Coverage → Enhancements
- Lighthouse → SEO audit
- Screaming Frog SEO Spider
- Meta preview tools (ahrefs, Yoast, etc.)

---

## Real-World SEO

### GitHub

- Titles change per repo, issue, file view
- Meta descriptions summarize repo purpose or issue content

### MDN Web Docs

- Structured, keyword-rich titles and concise meta summaries
- High CTR due to clear value props

## Conclusion: Tiny Tags, Huge Impact

Your `<title>` and `<meta>` tags are the **first impression** users see in Google.

They’re your headlines. Your hook. Your invitation.

Write them with purpose. Update them per page. Test them often.

Because the best content in the world can still be skipped — if no one clicks.
