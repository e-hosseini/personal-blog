# Optimize Loading Sequences — Deliver What Matters, First

Speed isn’t just about downloading fewer bytes. It’s about downloading the **right bytes** in the **right order**.

Your app might be fast — but if the user sees a blank screen while critical resources load last, they’ll think it’s slow.

**Loading sequence optimization** is the art of delivering:
- What’s visible first
- What’s interactive next
- What’s secondary later

In this guide, we’ll explore:
- Resource prioritization for fonts, images, scripts
- HTTP/2 and preload strategies
- HTML structure, skeleton UIs, and progressive enhancement
- Real-world sequencing patterns
- Performance metrics like LCP, FCP, and TTI

## Understanding the Critical Path

Every web page has a **critical rendering path**:
1. Browser loads HTML
2. Parses `<head>`, downloads scripts/CSS
3. Builds DOM and CSSOM trees
4. Renders first paint (FCP)
5. Shows largest element (LCP)
6. Allows interaction (TTI)

If your loading sequence blocks steps 3–5, users stare at empty screens.

---

## What Should Load First?

1. **HTML** — render something
2. **CSS** — styles make content readable
3. **Critical JS** — hydration and interactivity
4. **Fonts** — ideally preloaded
5. **Images above the fold**
6. **Data for above-the-fold components**

Everything else can wait.

## Techniques

### Inline Critical CSS

Inline CSS for above-the-fold components:

```html
<style>
  header { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }
</style>
```

Load the rest async.

### Preload Key Assets

```html
<link rel="preload" href="/fonts/inter.woff2" as="font" crossorigin>
<link rel="preload" href="/main.js" as="script">
```

Preload only what’s essential.

### Defer or Async Scripts

```html
<script src="/analytics.js" async></script>
<script src="/main.js" defer></script>
```

Never block rendering for non-critical JS.

---

## JavaScript Execution Order

Prefer:
- Early hydration of above-the-fold components
- Delayed hydration or lazy-load for below-the-fold
- Defer analytics, error tracking, social embeds

Use React.lazy + Suspense + loading indicators to stage rendering.

---

## Image Strategy

- Use `loading="lazy"` on offscreen images
- Preload hero images
- Prefer `srcset` for responsive loads
- Use placeholders (blurhash, LQIP, skeleton)

---

## Data Loading

For dynamic SPAs:
- Fetch above-the-fold data **in parallel** with component loading
- Use `Suspense` and `fallback` wisely
- Preload data using React Query or SWR’s `prefetchQuery`

---

## Real-World Example: Stripe Dashboard

1. Loads core shell + nav instantly
2. Prefetches customer data + sidebar metrics
3. Loads charts asynchronously
4. Lazy-loads less-used features (e.g. export CSV)

Results in fast paint, visible structure, then progressive enhancement.

---

## Performance Metrics That Matter

- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint): earliest feedback
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): when content is usable
- **TTI** (Time to Interactive): input responsiveness

Optimize loading sequence to minimize **LCP** and **TTI**.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- `<script>` blocking before `<body>` paint
- Lazy-loading above-the-fold content
- Fetching all data on mount (esp. for tabs not visible)
- Using custom font without fallback font during render
- Third-party tags that block TTI

---

## Conclusion: Fast is a Feeling, and Sequence is the Secret

Your app is only as fast as **what the user sees**.

If you prioritize visible content and defer the rest, users perceive speed — even if bytes still flow behind the scenes.

So order your load like you’d order a story:

Start with the most important page.

Then turn it.
