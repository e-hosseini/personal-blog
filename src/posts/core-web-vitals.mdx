# In-Depth Analysis of Core Web Vitals: Metrics That Matter Most in Frontend Performance

The concept of frontend performance has evolved beyond just the page load time. In the era of dynamic applications, Single Page Applications (SPAs), and rich user interactions, the speed of page loading is merely the first step.

The primary concern is the perceived speed or **how fast the web application feels to the user**.

Google introduced **Core Web Vitals** to address this concern. These metrics quantify user experience based on:
- The **speed** at which the content appears
- The **responsiveness** of the interface to user interaction
- The **stability** of the layout as the page loads

Since 2021, these metrics have become a part of Google's search ranking algorithm, making them more than just guidelines. 

In this article, we will delve into:
- The Core Web Vitals and their importance
- The working mechanism of these metrics and what constitutes good scores
- Tools and methodologies to measure these metrics
- Strategies for optimizing performance to meet the benchmarks
- Case studies of top companies leveraging Core Web Vitals

## An In-depth Look at Core Web Vitals

The Core Web Vitals include:

| Metric | What it measures | Good threshold |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | Time taken to render the largest visible content | < 2.5s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | Delay between user interaction and UI update | < 200ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Visual stability during load | < 0.1 |

These metrics are measured in the **field**, meaning they capture real user interactions on actual devices, providing a realistic reflection of the user experience.

## 1. LCP — Largest Contentful Paint

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) metric is a key indicator of perceived load speed. It measures the time it takes for the browser to render the largest content element visible in the viewport. This could be a block of text, an image, or a video poster. 

A high LCP value implies users are staring at a blank or partially loaded screen for longer, which is a poor user experience.

### Typical Causes of Poor LCP
- **Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS**: These block the rendering of the page until they are loaded and parsed.
- **Slow server response times**: This can be due to server location, server quality, or high traffic.
- **Resource load times**: Resources such as images, videos, or large JS files can take a long time to download.
- **Client-side rendering**: JS frameworks can cause significant delays before they become interactive.

### Optimization Techniques
- **Inline critical CSS**: This eliminates the need for the browser to fetch this CSS before rendering the page.
- **Preload important resources**: Using the `rel=preload` directive, resources can be loaded as soon as possible.
- **Compress text files**: Use Gzip or Brotli to reduce the size of text-based assets.
- **Minimize client-side JS**: Less JS means less to parse and execute, improving LCP times.

## 2. INP — Interaction to Next Paint

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) measures the delay between a user interaction and the subsequent paint event. Unlike First Input Delay (FID), which only considers the first interaction, INP captures all interactions over the page's lifetime and reports the worst-case scenario.

### Causes of High INP
- **Long tasks**: Any task that blocks the main thread for 50 ms or more can delay input response.
- **JavaScript execution time**: The longer a browser spends executing JS, the longer it takes to respond to user interactions.
- **Render-blocking resources**: These resources can delay the first paint of a page.

### Techniques to Improve INP
- **Break up Long Tasks**: Splitting long tasks into smaller, asynchronous tasks allows the page to remain responsive.
- **Optimize page for interaction readiness**: This can involve different code-splitting strategies, like breaking up code by route or component type.
- **Use a web worker**: Offload tasks to a background thread using a web worker.
- **Reduce JavaScript execution time**: Minimize the amount of JS that needs to be processed on page load.

## 3. CLS — Cumulative Layout Shift

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures the amount of unexpected layout shift of visible page content. It helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shifts.

### What Triggers CLS
- **Images without dimensions**: Always include width and height size attributes on your images and video elements.
- **Ads, embeds, and iframes without dimensions**: All embeds should have a reserved space.
- **Web Fonts causing FOIT/FOUT**: Flash of invisible text (FOIT) and flash of unstyled text (FOUT) can both contribute to CLS.
- **Actions waiting for a network response before updating DOM**: It can cause elements to shift unexpectedly.

### How to Prevent CLS
- **Use CSS aspect ratio boxes**: This will reserve the correct amount of space for an element until it loads.
- **Avoid inserting new content above existing content**: Except in response to user interaction.
- **Animate transitions**: Provide a smoother experience by animating transitions between states.
- **Optimize font loading**: Choose `font-display: optional` for fonts to reduce layout shifts.

## How to Measure Core Web Vitals

You can measure Core Web Vitals using various tools. Some of these tools simulate user interactions in a lab environment, while others capture data from real users, providing a more accurate reflection of performance in the real world.

### Lab Tools (Simulated)
- **Lighthouse**: A part of Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse provides a comprehensive performance report, including Core Web Vitals.
- **WebPageTest**: This online tool offers advanced testing capabilities and provides a detailed performance report.
- **PageSpeed Insights**: Powered by Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights analyzes the content of a web page and generates suggestions to make it faster.

### Field Tools (Real Users)
- **Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX)**: A public dataset of real user experience data on millions of websites.
- **`web-vitals` JavaScript library**: This library provides a set of functions to measure each of the Core Web Vitals.

```js
import { getLCP, getCLS, getINP } from 'web-vitals';

getLCP(console.log);
getCLS(console.log);
getINP(console.log);
```

The above code snippet uses the `web-vitals` library to log the LCP, CLS, and INP metrics to the console.

## Real-World Examples

Let's look at how some of the top companies are leveraging Core Web Vitals.

### Google Docs
Google Docs optimizes its performance by prioritizing the visibility of text and controls. It uses a partial hydration strategy to reduce JavaScript blocking. It also employs aggressive preloading for fonts and input handling to optimize LCP and INP.

### Shopify
Shopify uses `preconnect` and `preload` heavily on their storefronts to speed up the loading of assets. They also ensure heavy JavaScript hydration is blocked until LCP is completed, mitigating any impact on this crucial metric.

### Airbnb
Airbnb uses a skeleton loading strategy to prevent layout shifts, thereby optimizing CLS. They also focus on scroll performance to maintain good INP scores on their filters and maps.

## Continuous Optimization

Performance optimization is not a one-time task but a continuous process. Here are some practices to ensure continuous performance optimization:

- **Run Lighthouse in CI**: This helps catch performance regressions before they reach production.
- **Monitor with Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools over time**: This provides insights into how actual users are experiencing the site.
- **Set performance budgets for LCP, INP, and CLS in your build pipeline**: This ensures that performance doesn't regress over time.
- **Test across a variety of devices**: Performance on a high-end desktop can be very different from performance on a mid-tier mobile device.

## Anti-Patterns

While you work on optimizing your website, it's important to avoid certain anti-patterns that can negatively affect Core Web Vitals:

- **Rendering the entire UI after JavaScript hydration**: This can significantly delay LCP.
- **Lazy-loading all assets**: This can cause delays in LCP and INP as assets may not be available when the user needs them.
- **Styling layout after data load**: This can lead to layout shifts, negatively impacting CLS.
- **Large, single-threaded event handlers**: These can block the main thread, increasing INP.

## Conclusion: Metrics With Meaning

Core Web Vitals provide a way to measure real-world user experiences on the web. They help you optimize:

- **What users see** (LCP)
- **What users feel** (INP)
- **What users trust** (CLS)

Performance is not just about meeting benchmarks — it's about providing a smooth, enjoyable experience for the user. Measure it, monitor it, and continually optimize it.

Strive not just for fast, but for **delightfully fast** experiences.
