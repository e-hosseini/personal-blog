# Tree Shaking — Eliminate Dead Code and Ship Less JavaScript

What if you could remove all the parts of your code that were never used? That’s the promise of **tree shaking** — and it’s one of the most important tools in modern frontend performance optimization.

Tree shaking is a form of **dead code elimination** performed at bundle time. It analyzes your imports and dependencies, identifies which parts are unused, and removes them from the final bundle.

Think of it like pruning a tree: you keep only the branches you need.

In this deep guide, we’ll explore:
- What tree shaking is (and isn’t)
- How bundlers like Webpack and Rollup shake your code
- Patterns that break tree shaking
- How to write tree-shakeable modules
- Real-world optimizations from libraries like Lodash and Material UI

---

## A Brief History

The idea of dead code elimination comes from compiler theory, but in JavaScript, it wasn’t practical until **ES6 modules (ESM)**.

Why? Because prior to ESM, most code used CommonJS (`require()`), which is **dynamic** and not statically analyzable. Tree shaking requires **static structure** to work.

With ESM (`import { x } from "lib"`), bundlers can see which exports are used — and drop the rest.

Rollup was the first to popularize this for frontend, and Webpack followed with support in v2+.

---

## How Tree Shaking Works

Tree shaking relies on:
- **Static imports** (ESM syntax)
- **Pure functions** or side-effect-free code
- Bundlers that understand module graphs

Example:

```js
// math.js
export function add(x, y) { return x + y; }
export function subtract(x, y) { return x - y; }

// index.js
import { add } from './math';
```

If you never call `subtract()`, the bundler can drop it.

---

## Bundler Support

### Rollup

Rollup was built for ESM. Tree shaking is automatic and very effective — it can drop unused classes, functions, and imports easily.

```ts
export default {
  input: 'index.js',
  output: { file: 'bundle.js', format: 'esm' },
  treeshake: true
}
```

### Webpack

Webpack supports tree shaking when:
- Using ESM syntax
- `mode` is set to `"production"`
- `sideEffects` are marked correctly in `package.json`

```json
{
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

This tells Webpack it's safe to prune unused files/modules.

---

## Breaking Tree Shaking

Tree shaking **won’t work** if:
- You use CommonJS (`require()`)
- You import entire libraries (e.g., `import _ from "lodash"`)
- Modules have top-level side effects
- You mutate exports dynamically

Avoid patterns like:

```js
export const result = someFunction();
```

If `someFunction()` has side effects, bundlers will keep it.

---

## Real-World Case Studies

### Lodash

Historically, `import _ from 'lodash'` included the **entire library** (~70KB gzip). Now you can import individual functions:

```js
import debounce from 'lodash/debounce';
```

Or use **babel-plugin-lodash** to auto-optimize imports.

### Material UI

Early versions of MUI were not tree-shakeable. You had to import full component libraries. With v5+, ESM exports and emotion-styled components support full tree shaking.

---

## Writing Shakeable Code

- Use **pure exports** (stateless functions, constants)
- Avoid `export default` unless necessary
- Mark `sideEffects: false` in `package.json`
- Avoid dynamic `require()` or `eval`
- Structure your library into granular submodules

---

## Tools to Visualize Bundle

- **Webpack Bundle Analyzer**
- **Rollup Plugin Visualizer**
- **Source Map Explorer**

These tools help you **see what’s included** — and what’s not.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Using libraries without considering their size
- Re-exporting everything in index.js
- Mixing CommonJS and ESM
- Relying on runtime configuration for modularity

---

## Conclusion: Ship Only What You Need

Tree shaking is more than a bundler feature — it’s a **design philosophy**.

It rewards clarity. It punishes complexity.

If your code is structured well, you ship less — and your users get faster apps.

So prune those branches. Shake that tree.

And let your bundle breathe.
