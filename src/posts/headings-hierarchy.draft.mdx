# Headings Hierarchy — Structuring Content for Humans and Machines

Headings are not just visual design elements — they are the **backbone of your document's structure**.

Used correctly, they:
- Help users scan and understand content
- Enable screen readers to build a document outline
- Improve SEO and crawler performance
- Provide better keyboard navigation

Used incorrectly, they create **confusion and inaccessibility**.

In this article, we’ll explore:
- The semantics and hierarchy of HTML headings
- How screen readers interpret headings
- Best practices for structure and design
- Common mistakes and how to fix them

## Why Headings Matter

### For Sighted Users

Headings give visual structure to a page. They break up content into sections and subtopics.

### For Screen Reader Users

Headings are navigational landmarks. Users can:
- Jump between headings
- Skim via heading lists
- Understand page organization without reading every word

For example, in NVDA or VoiceOver:
- H key = next heading
- 1–6 keys = jump to heading level

## The HTML Heading Elements

HTML provides six heading elements:

```html
<h1>Page Title</h1>
<h2>Section</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
<h4>Sub-subsection</h4>
<h5>Rarely needed</h5>
<h6>Almost never needed</h6>
```

Each level represents **nested importance**, not just visual size.

---

## One `<h1>` Per Page

- The `<h1>` should represent the main topic of the page.
- Additional `<h1>`s can confuse assistive tech and dilute SEO signals.
- HTML5 **allows multiple `<h1>`s** in sectioning contexts (e.g., `<section>`), but practical support is inconsistent — so be cautious.

---

## Building Proper Hierarchies

Think like an outline:

```html
<h1>Main Topic</h1>
  <h2>Subtopic A</h2>
    <h3>Details A1</h3>
    <h3>Details A2</h3>
  <h2>Subtopic B</h2>
    <h3>Details B1</h3>
```

Don’t skip levels (e.g., `<h1>` → `<h4>`). It creates **semantic gaps**.

---

## Don't Use Headings for Style

This is a big accessibility sin.

```html
<h2 style="font-size: 12px">Just wanted it small</h2>
```

❌ Misleads screen readers.

Instead, style appropriately:

```html
<p class="section-subtitle">Just wanted it small</p>
```

Use CSS to **style**, HTML to **structure**.

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

- Multiple `<h1>`s with no sectioning
- Skipping heading levels (e.g., `<h2>` followed by `<h4>`)
- Headings used only for bold/large text
- Buttons or cards with headings used inside them semantically (e.g., `<h3>Buy now</h3>` in a button)

---

## Testing and Tools

- Use Lighthouse → Accessibility audit
- Use browser's “Accessibility Tree”
- NVDA/JAWS/VoiceOver: Navigate by heading level
- Use browser extensions like Axe, tota11y, or HeadingsMap

---

## Real-World Best Practices

### Government Sites

- Strict heading hierarchies
- Navigable by keyboard and screen reader
- `<h1>` for the page, `<h2>` for each major section, etc.

### MDN Web Docs

- Deeply nested content with strict heading structure
- Perfect for screen reader users skimming reference pages

## Conclusion: Structure Precedes Style

Headings are more than just text formatting.

They are the **semantic skeleton** of your content. And when structured well, they make the web easier to navigate, understand, and use — for everyone.

So next time you reach for an `<h3>`, ask: *does this follow the flow?*

Build documents that **speak clearly**, not just look good.
