# Visual Accessibility — Color Contrast, Font Size, and Readability

Not all accessibility is technical. A huge part is **visual**.

If users can’t see or read your content, they can’t use it — no matter how good your markup is.

Visual accessibility includes:
- Proper **color contrast**
- Reasonable **font sizes**
- Scalable layouts
- Readable typefaces

And it matters to more people than you think:
- Users with low vision
- Elderly users
- Colorblind users (8% of men!)
- People on low-quality screens or glare-heavy environments

This article walks through:
- WCAG contrast ratios
- Colorblind-friendly design
- Minimum font sizes and spacing
- Real-world tips and design anti-patterns

## Color Contrast

### What Is It?

Color contrast is the difference in luminance between foreground and background colors.

It affects:
- Readability
- Visibility
- Focus indicators
- Button states

### WCAG 2.1 Contrast Requirements

| Text Type           | Minimum Ratio |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Body text           | 4.5:1          |
| Large text (>18px bold or >24px normal) | 3:1    |
| UI elements (borders, input outlines) | 3:1     |
| Focus states        | Must be visible — WCAG doesn’t specify, but aim for 3:1+ |

Use tools like:
- [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- Chrome DevTools → Inspect Element → Accessibility → Contrast

## Colorblind-Safe Palettes

Relying only on color = exclusion.

Common traps:
- Green/red for success/error
- Yellow/orange pairs in forms
- Light blue/gray disabled states

Use icons, labels, underlines, or shapes **in addition** to color.

Example:
```html
<span class="error">
  <svg aria-hidden="true">...</svg>
  <span>Error: Invalid email</span>
</span>
```

## Font Size & Legibility

### Minimums

- Body text: **16px** minimum
- Buttons/input text: **16px**
- Headings: scale based on hierarchy (18px–32px+)

### Line Height

- Use at least **1.5 line height** for paragraphs

### Font Family

- Use **system fonts** or **accessible web fonts**
- Avoid overly thin, light-weight fonts
- Prefer variable font weight (400–700) for flexibility

---

## Scalable Typography

Use relative units (`rem`, `em`) instead of pixels:

```css
html {
  font-size: 100%; /* = 16px */
}
h1 {
  font-size: 2.5rem; /* = 40px */
}
```

Supports browser zoom and user preferences.

## Spacing and Layout

- Use padding for readability
- Avoid dense blocks of text
- Use generous spacing between lines and sections
- Maintain logical visual grouping for hierarchy

---

## Real-World Design Systems

### GOV.UK Design System

- Minimum 19px body font
- 1.5x line spacing
- Strict 4.5:1 contrast ratios
- No color-only UI cues

### Material Design

- Uses 14px–20px type ramp
- Automated contrast checking in components
- Focus outlines on all interactive elements

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Gray on white for placeholder text (too light)
- Light blue on white buttons (fails contrast)
- Tiny legal text at 12px or below
- Removing focus ring color or hover contrast
- Using pure red/green without icons or labels

---

## Testing Tips

- Use Chrome DevTools color contrast tools
- Use browser zoom to test at 150% and 200%
- Try grayscale mode (macOS or Windows)
- Use Chrome extensions like Axe or Stark
- Test on a low-end screen or phone under sunlight

## Conclusion: Design for Eyes, Not Just Aesthetics

Visual accessibility is often overlooked — but it’s **foundational**.

Good color contrast. Readable fonts. Responsive sizing.

These aren't just nice-to-haves — they're essential. For accessibility. For inclusivity. For real users in real conditions.

Design with empathy. Measure with tools. And always put clarity before style.

Because if they can't read it, they can't use it.
