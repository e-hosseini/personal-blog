# Reducing Reflows and Repaints — Taming the Browser’s Most Expensive Work

You’ve minimized your bundle. You’ve optimized your API. But your UI still lags, stutters, or feels “heavy”.

It might not be JavaScript. It might be the **browser itself** — recalculating layout, restyling, and repainting too often.

These are called **reflows** and **repaints**, and they’re some of the most expensive rendering operations in a browser.

In this article, you’ll learn:
- What reflows and repaints are
- How and when they happen
- How to detect and reduce them
- What triggers layout thrashing
- Real-world fixes and best practices

---

## What Is a Reflow?

A **reflow** (aka layout) happens when the browser recalculates the **geometry of the page**:
- Element positions
- Widths, heights
- Box models and stacking

Changes to DOM size or position often trigger reflows.

---

## What Is a Repaint?

A **repaint** redraws parts of the screen after a style change:
- Color
- Shadow
- Visibility

Repaint is cheaper than reflow, but still expensive — especially on large surfaces.

---

## What Triggers Reflows?

- Adding/removing DOM nodes
- Changing layout-affecting styles (e.g. `display`, `height`, `margin`)
- Calling measurement APIs: `offsetHeight`, `getBoundingClientRect`
- Animating properties that require layout

---

## How to Detect Them

### Chrome DevTools

- Open Performance tab → record interaction
- Look for “Recalculate Style”, “Layout”, “Paint”, “Composite Layers”
- Use Paint Flashing (Rendering panel) to see repaints visually

### Use `console.time()` to measure critical paths

```js
console.time("layout");
element.offsetHeight;
console.timeEnd("layout");
```

---

## Techniques to Avoid Thrashing

### Read, then Write

Avoid interleaving:

❌ Bad:

```js
el.style.width = "100px";
const h = el.offsetHeight;
el.style.border = "1px solid red";
```

✅ Good:

```js
const h = el.offsetHeight;
el.style.width = "100px";
el.style.border = "1px solid red";
```

---

### Avoid Layout-Affecting Animations

❌ Avoid:

```css
transition: height 0.3s;
```

✅ Prefer:

```css
transition: transform 0.3s;
```

Use `transform` and `opacity` — they're GPU-accelerated and don't require layout.

---

## Use CSS Containment

```css
.card {
  contain: layout paint;
}
```

Tells browser not to reflow beyond this boundary.

Improves performance in dynamic UIs.

---

## Virtualization Helps

Large lists? Virtualize them.

Avoid letting the DOM grow unbounded — it increases reflow cost for every frame.

Use `react-window`, `react-virtual`, or intersection observers.

---

## Real-World Fixes

### GitHub

- Lazy-loads diff view rows to avoid large layouts
- Replaces collapsing regions with `height: auto` + transition hack

### Airbnb

- Moved from height-based animations to transforms on calendar/date pickers
- Reduced mobile layout shift dramatically

### Shopify

- Uses React concurrent features to schedule layout-heavy updates

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`
- Reading layout mid-animation
- DOM manipulations inside requestAnimationFrame with layout reads
- Synchronous style reads in scroll/resize handlers

---

## Conclusion: Don’t Let Layout Be Your Bottleneck

Reflows and repaints are expensive — not just in CPU cycles, but in **perceived fluidity**.

Users feel them as jank. As lag. As dropped frames.

So keep your UI flowing by keeping layout **predictable** and **contained**.

You can’t avoid reflows entirely — but you can sure stop them from ruining your rhythm.
